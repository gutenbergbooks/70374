must confess that when we published Mr. Philip Norman’s appeal
to the Government to save Clifford’s Inn, we had little hope that
the appeal would be listened to; it is too much to expect an English
Government to take any interest in a question of an artistic nature; in
agreeing to ignore such questions the unanimity of political parties is
wonderful. Nor does the English public really care about such matters.
The appeal received considerable support in the press, but it was a
support given by men who, whatever they themselves think, know well
enough that an agitation for the preservation of an ancient building
would only bore most of their readers. ¶ So Clifford’s Inn has been
sold, and sold at a ridiculously low price. It is some satisfaction
to know that legal education, which condemned it to destruction, will
profit little if at all by its sale, for the income derived from the
purchase money can be no larger than could have been derived from the
rents of the Inn under proper management. The end, however, is not
yet, for the gentleman who now owns Clifford’s Inn is happily not
without appreciation of its artistic and historical interest; for
the present, at any rate, he will leave matters in <i>statu quo</i>,
and all the tenants have been informed that they need not fear early
ejection. Moreover we have every reason to believe that, if there
were any movement to preserve the Inn, the present owner would be
willing to part with his property at a very moderate premium on the
sum of £100,000 that he paid for it. ¶ The London County Council—the
only public authority in London that cares about such matters—has
had its eye on Clifford’s Inn, and a committee of the Council only
refrained from recommending its purchase from fear of the ratepayers.
We would, however, appeal to the County Council to cast aside fear
of the Philistines and reconsider the matter. Expert opinion in such
matters holds that Clifford’s Inn could be made, as it stands, to
return £3,000 a year; its purchase, therefore, at a little more than
£100,000 would involve little or no loss to the ratepayers. The County
Council has done and is doing admirable work for the preservation
of ancient buildings; it might well add to its laurels by acquiring
Clifford’s Inn for the citizens of London. ¶ The case of Clifford’s Inn
raises the larger question of the preservation of ancient buildings
generally. We in England pretend to be an artistic nation; we talk and
write very much about art, and we all collect more or less works of
art or imitations thereof; most of us try to paint pictures, and the
world will soon be unable to contain the pictures that are painted.
But there is one fact that brands us as hypocrites, the fact that
Great Britain shares with Russia and Turkey the odious peculiarity of
being without legislation of any kind for the protection of ancient
buildings and other works of art such as is possessed to some degree
by every other country in Europe, and by almost every State of the
American Union. We have calmly looked on while amiable clergymen,
restoring architects, and legal peers with a mania for bricks and
mortar and more money than taste, have hacked, hewn, scraped and
pulled to pieces the greatest architectural works of our forefathers;
too many modern architects, when they are not engaged in copying the
work of their predecessors, are engaged in destroying it. Though the
legend of ‘Cromwell’s soldiers’ still on the lips of the intelligent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
pew-opener accounts for the havoc wrought in many an ancient church,
the historian and the antiquary know that to the sixteenth and not the
seventeenth century must that havoc be in the first place attributed,
and the observer of recent history knows that the mischief worked by
the iconoclast of the sixteenth century has been far exceeded by that
worked by the restorer and the Gothic revivalist of the nineteenth.
And if this has been done by persons who imagined themselves to be
artistic and were actuated by the best possible motives, what has been
the destruction wrought by those who made no profession of any motive
but that of commercial advantage? Within the memory of the youngest
among us, buildings of great artistic and historical interest have been
ruthlessly swept away in London and in every other town in the kingdom,
and the few that have been left are rapidly disappearing. ¶ There is
no way of saving the remnant of our heritage but that of legislation;
but we cannot honestly recommend the advocacy of such legislation to
a minister or a party in need of an electioneering cry, and we are
not sanguine as to the prospects of anything being done. Still, it
may be interesting to some to learn what the despised foreigner has
done in this respect; we take the information from a Parliamentary
paper presented to the House of Commons on July 30, 1897.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> ¶ We will
briefly summarize the facts given in this paper, referring those of
our readers who wish for further information to the paper itself. In
Austria there has existed for many years a permanent ‘Imperial and
Royal Commission for the investigation and preservation of artistic and
historical monuments.’ This Commission had, in 1897, direct rights only
over monuments belonging to the State (in which churches are included);
but it acted in concert with municipalities and learned societies, and
promoted the formation of local societies to carry out its objects. No
ancient monument coming within its scope can be touched without the
sanction of the Commission. Since 1897 its powers have, we believe,
been extended. Not only buildings, but objects of art and handicraft
of every kind as well as manuscripts and archives, of any date up to
the end of the eighteenth century, come within the scope of activity of
the Commission, which is a consultative body advising the Minister of
Public Worship and Education, who is the executive authority for these
purposes. ¶ In Bavaria, alterations to all monuments or buildings of
historical or artistic importance (including churches) belonging to
the State, municipality, or any endowed institution, have, since 1872,
required the sanction of the Sovereign, who is advised by the Royal
Commissioners of Public Buildings. The ecclesiastical authorities and
even religious communities are prohibited from altering a church or
dealing with its furniture without the consent of the Commissioners.
¶ In Denmark there has been a Royal Commission with similar objects
since 1807; ancient monuments are scheduled, and since 1873 the Royal
Commission has had power to acquire them compulsorily if their owners
will not take proper measures for their preservation. ¶ In France
the Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts, who is advised by
a Commission of Historical Monuments, has as drastic powers as the
Danish Royal Commission; some 1,700 churches, castles, and other
buildings (including buildings in private ownership) have been
scheduled and classified, and cannot be destroyed, restored, repaired,
or altered except with the approval of the Minister, who has power to
expropriate private owners under certain circumstances. ¶ Belgium has
statutory provisions of a similar character; there a Royal Commission
on Monuments was constituted so long ago as 1835, so that Belgium is
second only to Denmark in this matter. The Commission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span> may schedule
any building or ancient monument, and the scheduled building cannot be
touched without the consent of the Commission, even if it is in private
ownership. In Belgium, as in France and Denmark, grants of public money
are given for the purchase and preservation of ancient monuments, and
the Belgian municipalities are very zealous in the same direction. In
Bruges, we understand, the façades of all the houses belong to the
municipality, so that their preservation is secured, and also congruity
in the case of new buildings. No object of art may legally be alienated
or removed from a Belgian church; this law, however, is unfortunately
still evaded to some extent. ¶ In Italy several laws have been passed,
beginning with an edict of Cardinal Pacca for the old Papal States in
1820. The Minister of Public Instruction may, by a decree, declare
any building a national monument, and the municipalities have large
powers; works of art, as is well known, cannot legally be taken out of
Italy, but this law is often evaded. ¶ In Greece the powers of the
State are perhaps more drastic than anywhere else. Even antique works
of art in private collections are considered as national property in a
sense and their owner can be punished for injuring them; if the owner
of an ancient building attempts to demolish it or refuses to keep it
in repair, the State may expropriate him. ¶ Holland, Prussia, Saxony,
Spain, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, and many American States have
provisions of a more or less stringent character with the same purpose.
But we need not now go further into details; the whole of the facts
will be found in the Parliamentary paper, and we have given enough of
them to show how far behind every other civilized country England is in
this matter. The protection of monuments of the past which Denmark has
had for nearly a century and Belgium for nearly seventy years we have
not yet thought of. Surely the time has come to wipe out this reproach;
until it is wiped out let us have done with the hypocritical claim that
we are an artistic people.</p>

TO DEALERS</h3>

the April number of T<span class="smaller">HE</span> B<span class="smaller">URLINGTON</span> M<span class="smaller">AGAZINE</span> we stated that
it was our intention not to exclude from the Magazine works of art
likely to be of interest to the student and collector because they
happened to be in the hands of dealers. The policy of including objects
belonging to dealers has been adversely criticized by friends who have
the interests of the Magazine at heart; we therefore think it well
to refer again to the matter, although the purpose of our decision
was, as it seems to us, clearly enough stated in the April number.
Suggestions have, it seems, been made in certain quarters that some
corrupt or at least commercial arrangement with the dealers concerned
is accountable for the publication in the Magazine of objects belonging
to them. Such suggestions we may pass over, for they are not and will
not be credited by anyone whose opinion need concern us. But we owe
it to the friendly critics who are concerned for the welfare of the
Magazine, and anxious that it should not be affected even by a breath
of suspicion, to state our position quite frankly. ¶ In the first place
we may say that we entirely sympathize with their point of view, and we
recognize as fully as they do the harm that has been done to artistic
enterprises—literary and otherwise—by commercial entanglements,
and, in the case of periodicals, by a too intimate relation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span> between
the advertisement and editorial pages. So much has this been the case
that we are not surprised at the alarm which is felt by some of our
friends lest even a suspicion of a similar tendency should attach to
a periodical in the success of which they are, we are glad to know,
keenly interested. But we would point out that in such cases as those
to which we have referred far more subtle methods are resorted to than
that of frankly publishing a work of art that may happen to be for
the time in the hands of a dealer; a little reflection will convince
anyone that an Editor of a periodical ostensibly devoted to art, if
he wishes—to put it quite plainly—to puff the goods of this or that
individual, does not set about it in so palpable a way as that of
publishing without subterfuge objects which are frankly stated to be
in the possession of the individual or individuals whom it is desired
to advertise. It is the very purity of our motives that has enabled
us to take a course the boldness of which we do not for a moment
deny. Nor must it be supposed that the publication of works of art in
their possession is necessarily desired by the dealers themselves; on
the contrary, as is well known to every one with experience in these
matters, the idiosyncrasies of collectors are such that in many cases a
dealer who has a fine work of art in his possession does not wish it to
be generally known. We have in some cases had considerable difficulty
in inducing dealers to allow their property to be reproduced, and we
will go so far as to say that, strange as it may seem to the purist
in these matters, we believe that some of them are really actuated
by a desire to assist the study of art. It would be false modesty on
our part to affect to believe that publication of a work of art in
T<span class="smaller">HE</span> B<span class="smaller">URLINGTON</span> M<span class="smaller">AGAZINE</span> is injurious to the owner, whether
dealer or collector; we are willing to admit that such publication
may, on the contrary, be advantageous to the owner of the work of art
published. But, surely, that is not the question to be considered; the
only question, it seems to us, is whether the work of art is likely
to be of interest to readers of T<span class="smaller">HE</span> B<span class="smaller">URLINGTON</span> M<span class="smaller">AGAZINE</span> and
of value to students. This is, at any rate, the only question that we
have taken into consideration; and we have felt that if any particular
work of art is of interest to our readers, and particularly to those
who make a special study of the branch of art concerned, we ought not
to hesitate to publish it merely because it happens to be in the hands
of a dealer. ¶ Is there not after all just a suspicion of cant in
this squeamishness about the publication of pictures or other objects
belonging to dealers? Even private collectors have, we believe, been
known to sell objects out of their collections, and, so far as our
information goes, they do not invariably sell them at a loss; indeed,
when one comes to define the boundary between collecting and dealing
one finds a considerable difficulty in doing so with exactitude; the
border country between the two is very wide in extent and very hazy.
We have heard of cases in which private collectors, who would not for
the world be considered to be dealers, have written anonymously in a
periodical about objects in their own possession and then put them up
to auction with a quotation from their own article in the catalogue.
Any such practice as that we shall certainly discourage or rather
repress; these are difficulties which beset the path of an editor of
an art periodical. But if we are to be deterred by such difficulties
it will end in our being afraid to publish any work of art in case
we haply enhance its value, and thus indirectly do a service to its
owner. ¶ Let us restate more fully the case which we have already
stated shortly in the April number of this Magazine. At any given time
there are in the hands of London dealers not a few pictures which are
of profound interest to all students of art, and which may indeed
throw light on vexed problems and assist in their solution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span> Are we
to deprive the readers of T<span class="smaller">HE</span> B<span class="smaller">URLINGTON</span> M<span class="smaller">AGAZINE</span> of the
opportunities which the publication of such pictures may give them?
Doubtless in a normal state of things such pictures would ultimately
find their way either into the National Gallery or at least into the
possession of some English collector. But as things are they are
far more likely to find a home either, let us say, in the Berlin,
Amsterdam, or Munich Museum, or in a private collection on the other
side of the Atlantic; and it may be very difficult to trace them if
the opportunity is lost of publishing them while they are in London.
Were the National Gallery still a buyer of pictures, it might not be
necessary for a periodical to take such a course as we have taken.
But it is notorious that the National Gallery is no longer a buyer of
pictures; not merely is the money allotted by the Government absurdly
inadequate, but it is also the case that, inadequate as it is, it is
not made the best use of. Only last month Mr. Weale pointed out in
this Magazine that the Berlin Gallery had recently bought for £1,000 a
charming picture by a rare Flemish master, which was sold at Christie’s
eight years ago for £3 10s., and this is merely one example of the
almost innumerable opportunities that escape those who at present
direct the National Gallery. Although we are told that present prices
in England are prohibitive so far as public collections are concerned,
it is nevertheless the fact that museums such as those of Berlin,
Boston, Munich, and Amsterdam find it worth while to buy largely in
London, and we do not suppose that they always pay exorbitant prices,
although of course a large and wealthy country like Bavaria can afford
to spend more on art than a country like England. In former years a
London dealer who had a particularly fine picture in his possession
would have offered it to the National Gallery; now that is the last
thing that he thinks of doing; he knows too well that the authorities
of the National Gallery would probably not take the trouble even to
look at it, and that some of those who would have a voice in deciding
whether it should be purchased have not the necessary qualifications
for making such a decision. The evil has been increased by the insane
rule now in force, that the trustees of the National Gallery must be
unanimous before any picture is purchased—a rule which, as anyone with
sense would have foreseen, has led to an absolute deadlock. Within the
last few weeks, for instance, the chance of purchasing a superb work of
Frans Hals at a very moderate price has been lost to the nation, simply
because one of the trustees of the National Gallery refuses to agree
to any purchase that does not suit his own preference for art of what
may be called the glorified chocolate-box type. ¶ But we need not now
enlarge upon this subject, with which we hope to deal at some future
time; we have said enough perhaps to support our contention that it is
hopeless to expect that fine pictures which have passed into the hands
of London dealers will find their way into that collection which has
been made by former directors one of the most representative in the
world of the best European art. This being so, we feel very strongly
that we ought to risk something in order to give the readers of
T<span class="smaller">HE</span> B<span class="smaller">URLINGTON</span> M<span class="smaller">AGAZINE</span> the opportunity of seeing, at least,
reproductions of works of art which they may otherwise never have
the opportunity of seeing. At the same time we cannot lightly reject
the objections which have been raised by those who, as we know, have
only the best interests of T<span class="smaller">HE</span> B<span class="smaller">URLINGTON</span> M<span class="smaller">AGAZINE</span> at heart;
and, while we do not at present feel disposed to alter our policy
in this respect, we are nevertheless open to argument, and if the
considerations which we have put forward can be shown to be unsound or
inadequate we are prepared to be convinced. We invite from our readers
expressions of opinion on the subject.</p>

the burly Landsknechte stormed the walls of the deer park and
therewith won the hard-fought battle of Pavia, one of the treasures
they captured in Francis’s sumptuous gold-laden tents was a vellum
Codex of folio size, almost every leaf of which bore beautifully
illuminated pictures of hunting scenes. We know from other evidence
that this precious volume was one of the favourite books of the
luxury-loving French king, and the fact that he took it with him to
the Italian wars in preference to a printed copy, infinitely more
portable, such as had been turned out in three different editions by
the hand-presses of Antoine Verard, Trepperel, and Philippe le Noir, is
a further proof that Francis’s love for finely illuminated manuscript
was a ruling passion with him. It is this very MS. which forms the
subject of these lines, and the facsimile reproductions, which the
writer obtained permission to have executed by competent hands, show
the rare skill of the fifteenth-century miniaturist of whose identity
we unfortunately know but little. ¶The history of this Codex is an
extremely interesting one and well worth the research expended upon
it by Gaucheraud, Joseph Lavallée, Werth, and others. The eighty-five
chapters are written in a wonderfully regular and perfect hand, and
the ink is today as black and clean of outline as it was four and a
half centuries ago. The author of what is unquestionably the most
beautiful hunting manuscript extant was Count Gaston de Foix, the
oft-cited patron of Froissart. This great noble and hunter began the
book on May Day 1387, and we know that it was completed when a fit
of apoplexy, after a bear hunt, cut short his remarkable career four
years later, when he was in his sixty-first year. Of the forty, or
possibly forty-one, ancient copies of this hunting book that have come
down to us, one or two were written it is almost certain during the
author’s lifetime, though the original itself, which was dedicated by
Gaston to ‘Phelippes de France, duc de Bourgoigne,’ disappeared in a
mysterious manner from the Escurial during the eventful year of 1809,
and has not turned up since. None of the other contemporary copies
have illuminations at all comparable to those in our MS., for the
simple reason that it was not until some decades later that art had
reached, even in France, the brilliancy that our illuminations show.
For although Argote de Molina—who in his ‘Libro de la Monteria,’
published in Seville in 1582, describes the lost original—says ‘el
qual se vee illuminado de excelente mano,’ it is safe to say that,
could we place the original side by side with the MS. of which we are
speaking, its illuminations would be found to be far inferior to those
in the MS. owned by Francis I. ¶ Very likely the lost original MS. was
written by one or the other of the four secretaries Froissart tells
us were constantly employed by Count de Foix. These he did not call
John, or Gautier, or William, but nicknamed them ‘Bad-me-serve,’ or
‘Good-for-nothings.’ The illuminations were probably the work of some
wandering master-illuminator attracted to the splendid court at Orthéz
by the Count’s well-known prodigal liberality. ¶ Gaston de Foix, to
interrupt for a brief spell our tale, was the lord of Foix and Béarn;
buffer countships at the foot of the Pyrenees—the castle of Pau was
one of Foix’s strongholds. He succeeded, as Gaston III, at the age of
twelve to his principalities. Two years later he was serving against
the English, and shortly afterwards was made ‘Lieutenant de Roi’ in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Languedoc and Gascony, and at the age of eighteen he married Agnes
daughter of Philip III King of Navarre. His person was so handsome,
his bodily strength so great, his hair of such sunny golden hue,
that he acquired the name of <i>Le Roi Phoebus</i> or <i>Gaston
Phoebus</i>, by which latter both he and his hunting book have gone
down to posterity.</p>

<p>The oldest copy that is extant is preserved in
the same treasure-house that contains our MS. and some fourteen other
copies of it, namely the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. It bears the
number 619 (anc. 7,098), while our MS. is numbered f.fr. 616 (anc.
7,097), and if P. Paris MSS. Franc. V 217 is right, it was Gaston’s
working copy. The pictures in this MS. are shaded black-and-white
drawings, and are not illuminations. That its origin was the south
of France is proved, as M. Joseph Lavallée says, by the spelling of
certain words: <i>car</i> being spelt <i>guar</i>, <i>baigner</i> as
<i>bainher</i>, <i>montagne</i> as <i>montainhe</i>, a manner peculiar
in the fourteenth century to the langue d’Oc. The fact that in the
MS. 616 these words are spelt in the more modern fashion supports
the theory, according to the last-mentioned authority, that it was
written at a later date, <i>i.e.</i> in the first half of the fifteenth
century, thus confirming the impression already produced by the far
superior illuminations in MS. 616. These latter, as we see by a glance
at the two full-page reproductions, somewhat reduced in size though
they necessarily had to be to find space in this place, evince the
unmistakable signs of having been created during a period of transition
in the miniaturist’s art. For while the one has the characteristic
diapered background, the other has a more realistic horizon, which
betokens a later origin than the beginning of the fifteenth century. Of
the eighty-seven illuminations in our MS. 616, only four have a natural
horizon as background, the rest are diapered in the conventional older
manner, in the invention of which the miniaturists of the fourteenth
century developed a perfectly wonderful ingenuity, and of which this
exquisite Codex is one of the most remarkable examples. ¶ In the
opinion of some experts the illuminations in MS. 616 are by the hand
of the famous Jean Foucquet, born about 1415, who was made painter
and valet-de-chambre to Charles VII. Amongst the choicest works of
this artist rank, it is perhaps hardly necessary to mention, the
Book of Hours that he executed for Estienne Chevalier, Charles VII’s
Treasurer, another Hours which he made for the Duchess Marie of Cleves,
and most famous of all the ninety miniatures of the <i>Boccaccio</i>
of Estienne Chevalier which is one of the principal treasures of the
Royal Library in Munich. Those who are acquainted with Count Bastard’s
monumental work will probably discover a distinct resemblance between
one of his reproductions, especially in the foliage and scroll work,
and the two full-page pictures now before the reader. On the other
hand, the opinion of such a painstaking critic as is Levallée deserves
attention. According to him—and nobody expended more time and trouble
in <i>Gaston Phoebus</i> researches—the illuminations are not by
Foucquet’s hand, but possibly by an artist of his school. If they are
Foucquet’s, they cannot have been executed before 1440, or at the
earliest 1435. ¶ And now to return to the romantic history of our
Codex. On one of the front leaves is painted a large coat-of-arms.
It is that of the Saint-Vallier family, and two events connected
with the then possessors of this precious manuscript throw a telling
sidelight upon French social conditions at the period to which the
opening scene on Pavia’s bloody field has introduced us. A generation
before that event, namely in 1477, Jacques de Brézé, a rich noble of
well-known sporting proclivities, returning suddenly home found his
wife in a compromising position with a young noble. Swords flashed on
slighter provocation than this one in those days, and the angry husband
killed both the lover and his wife without further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span> ado. Unhappily
for him, the latter was no less a personage than Charlotte of France,
natural daughter of Charles VII, and it cost the stern husband a fine
of 100,000 ducats, a huge sum in those days, and a couple of years’
confinement in a castle to save his life. The eldest of the six
children who were made motherless by this event subsequently married
Diane of Poitiers, who not long afterwards became the all-powerful
mistress of Francis I, and later on of Henry II, his son. Now Diane de
Poitiers was the daughter of Jean de Poitiers, Sieur of Saint-Vallier,
on whom his King (Louis IX) had bestowed the hand of his natural
daughter Marie. The Codex whose reproductions we have before us had
been given, probably as part of the King’s dower, to Jean de Poitiers’s
wife, hence the armorial bearings. If we want to become acquainted
with the circumstances that probably were the cause of its presence
in King Francis’s tents on the eventful day of Pavia, we have to turn
to another tragic event which occurred two years before Pavia. In
1523 Jean de Poitiers involved himself in the Connétable de Bourbon’s
conspiracy, and the discovery by the King’s minions, among Jean’s
secret papers, of the code treacherously used by the Connétable in his
correspondence with Charles V of Germany, sent Jean speedily to the
scaffold. He was in the act of kneeling down to receive the deathblow
when the pardon obtained by his daughter from her royal lover, the
King, saved his life. But all his goods and chattels were confiscated
by Francis I, and amongst them was most probably our Codex, and thus
it came to form part of the vast booty captured by Emperor Charles’s
rough-handed Landsknechte. ¶ These formidable soldiers, who, under
their giant leader, Georg von Frundsberg, had performed in the Italian
campaigns deeds of great prowess—they were really the first trained
infantry—were recruited almost exclusively in Tyrol, and for this
reason it is not surprising that the next authentic news we have of
our Codex is from that country. Bishop Bernard of Trent purchased it
evidently from some returning booty-laden Landsknecht, and, recognising
its great value, he presented it about the year 1530 to Archduke
Ferdinand, Duke of Tyrol, one of the greatest collectors of his time,
whose museum and library at his castle Ambras, near Innsbruck, was the
wonder of the day. ¶ It remained in the possession of the Hapsburgs
for about 130 years, when victory returned it once more to the country
from whence defeat had removed it. During Turenne’s campaign in the
Netherlands, General the Marquis of Vigneau became possessed of the
volume—how remains unfortunately a mystery—and on his return to Paris
presented it, July 22, 1661, to his King, Louis XIV. Bishop Bernard’s
and General Vigneau’s dedications to the respective royalties are
inscribed on the fly leaves, the former, in the shape of a long-winded
Latin ‘humblest offering,’ taking up a good deal of space, though,
unlike the Frenchman’s dedication, it fails to indicate the year when
the presentation was made. ¶ Louis XIV deposited it in the Royal
Library, where it received its librarian’s birthmark, the number 7,097,
which it retained down to recent days, when it was rechristened, to be
known henceforth, as already stated, as MS. 616. It never should have
left those sacred halls, but Louis XIV was no venerator of his own law
when it suited him to break it. Regretting his gift to the Library, a
few years afterwards he demanded the volume back, and back again he got
it, his son, the Count of Toulouse, becoming the next owner of it. From
him it passed to Orleans princes until, in the fateful year 1848, it
formed part of the private library of Louis Philippe at Neuilly, when
that royal residence was plundered and fired by the populace.</p>

<p>By a wonder it escaped complete destruction on that occasion, and though the
covers were badly damaged and blood-bespattered, the inside of the book
was left intact. Although a new cover of somewhat gaudy modernity has
been supplied to it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
consequence of the fiery ordeal through which it had passed, the
student visiting the great Paris library, where this unique Codex is
exhibited in what is known as the <i>Reserve</i>, will find its vellum
leaves in very much the same perfect condition as they were when
Diane de Poitiers and Francis I turned them over with the care that
is bestowed upon a work one loves. ¶ Another fine copy of <i>Gaston
Phoebus</i> is preserved in the late Duc d’Aumale’s magnificent library
at Chantilly, now the property of the French nation. When recently
making some researches there the writer came across a pathetic little
note in the late Duke’s catalogue respecting our Codex, which, as
we have heard, belonged to the House of Orleans for upwards of a
century. It occurs where the Duc d’Aumale speaks of the MS. 616, and
it runs: ‘Saved from the conflagration of 1848, it was taken to the
Bibliothèque Nationale, but our appeals for a return of the volume
addressed to the Conservateurs of the Library were rejected, however
well founded we considered our claim!’ The miniatures in the Chantilly
copy are finely drawn, but evince in some instances a grotesqueness
which is absent from those adorning MS. 616. Thus the much suffering
reindeer comes in for some exceedingly quaint limning, with antlers
of perfectly ludicrous proportions and a coat like an Angora goat’s.
¶ One curious fact obtrudes itself upon our notice as we examine the
illumination in almost all the <i>Gaston Phoebus</i> copies that are
adorned with illuminations (the majority of the existing forty MSS. are
not illuminated, or at best only with very inferior pictures). It is
the bright colours of the huntsmen’s dress in the fifteenth century.
With the exception of the wild-boar hunters, who are generally garbed
in grey costumes, mounted and unmounted hunters engaged in the pursuit
of the stag, buck, bear, otter, fox, wild cat, wolf, hare, and badger,
wear with curious promiscuousness blue, scarlet, mauve, white, and
yellow costume quite as often as they appear in the more orthodox
green-coloured dress. It may possibly have been merely an instance of
artistic licence on the part of the miniaturists, for according to the
text grey and green were the only colours of venery known to the good
<i>veneur</i>. ¶ To come to the contents of our MS. we can introduce
it by the broad statement that <i>Gaston Phoebus</i> is the first
mediaeval hunting-book in prose that does not deal with the subject
in the catechism-like form of question and answer. The few previous
prose works that have come down to us take the form of questions
asked by the keen young apprentice and answered by his instructor,
an experienced <i>veneur</i>, explaining to him the A B C of venery.
Some bits in Gaston’s <i>Livre de Chasse</i> are borrowed from <i>Roy
Modus</i>, written about sixty years earlier, some from Gace de la
Buigne (or Vigne), King John’s first chaplain, written less than thirty
years earlier, and a few from <i>La Chace dou Serf</i>, a poetic
effusion of the second half of the thirteenth century. But taking it
as a whole <i>Gaston Phoebus</i> is unquestionably as original as
could be any work upon such a popular subject as hunting then was. ¶
To those who know their Froissart, Count Gaston de Foix’s personality
will be very familiar; but, considering that the chronicler’s visit
occurred in 1388, the year after the commencement of the <i>Livre
de Chasse</i>, it is somewhat strange, in view of his long stay and
intimate intercourse at the Count’s court, that he does not mention
the <i>opus</i> upon which his host was then engaged. ¶ The prologue
mirrors in a characteristic manner the spirit of the age, as does also
the last miniature in MS. 616, which represents the noble sportsman in
an attitude of beatitude kneeling in a chapel. That Gaston was a pious
lord we can see by the score or so of Latin prayers said to have been
composed by him in the dire hour of mortal distress after the tragic
death of his only son by his—the father’s—hand. ‘By the Grace of
God’ Count Gaston speaks wisely and well of the good qualities that
a hunter should have, and how hunting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span> causeth a man to eschew the
seven deadly sins, concluding his homily with a sentiment that appeals
to the sportsman of the twentieth century as much as it did to him
of the fourteenth. ‘And also, say I, that there is no man who loves
hunting that has not many good qualities in him, for they come from the
nobleness and gentleness of his heart of whatsoever estate he be, great
lord or little, poor or rich.’ ¶ The prologue once finished, Gaston
starts with zest on his task, beginning with the stag, or, to be quite
correct, with the ‘nature’ of what was considered in all Continental
hunting the most important beast of venery. The next thirteen chapters
deal respectively in a similar way with the natural history of the
reindeer, the fallow deer, the ‘bouc,’ under which the ibex and the
chamois were included, the roe-deer, the hare, the rabbit, the bear,
the wild boar, the wolf, the fox, the badger, the wild cat, and the
otter. ¶ Following these fourteen chapters, we get ten very interesting
ones on the various kinds of sporting hounds, their training,
treatment when ill, the construction and management of the kennel, and
other details relating to the subject. In Gaston’s time there were
five kinds; the first is the Alaunt, which he subdivides into the
<i>Alaunt gentle</i> and the <i>Alaunt veautres</i>; the second is
the <i>levrier</i> or greyhound; the third the <i>chien courant</i>
or running hound; the fourth the bird dog or <i>espainholz</i>, from
which the modern spaniel has sprung; and the fifth the <i>mastin</i> or
mastiff. Then come two chapters on how to make nets, and how to blow
and trumpet, followed by eighteen chapters on how to track the stag and
the wild boar, and how to judge of their presence, size, age, etc., by
the various signs known to the <i>veneur</i>, who made a very exact
science of what we would call woodcraft. The next fifteen chapters
relate to the chase proper of the fourteen beasts named at first,
with a double chapter on the chase of the wild boar. The concluding
twenty-six chapters deal with the various manners of netting, snaring,
trapping, and poisoning of wild beasts of prey and other less noxious
animals. They are mostly short chapters, and in more than one place
the author displays his unwillingness to deal with matter that a good
sportsman need have no ken of, except in so far as was necessary to
keep down vermin and destroy ‘marauders of the woods’ for the benefit
of his legitimate quarry. ¶ Certain historians have called <i>Gaston
Phoebus</i> a ‘cruel voluptuary,’ and no doubt some of his repressive
measures sound unnecessarily harsh, not to say merciless, in these
soft times; but the spirit in which he wrote his famous book is
unquestionably that of a really good sportsman who abhors all underhand
advantages that curtail the hunted beast’s chances, and who takes his
bear or wild boar single-handed, and pursues his stag to a finish, be
the forest a trackless maze, and the river to which the hunted deer
finally takes a swift flowing stream, into which to plunge is but
a minor incident of an exciting sport. ¶ Of the forty or forty-one
ancient MS. copies of <i>Gaston Phoebus</i> that are known to exist
in Europe to-day, twenty-one are in France, fifteen keeping our MS.
616 company on the shelves of the Bibliothèque Nationale. <a id="Vatican_Library"></a>Five form
part of the Vatican Library, and six adorn the principal libraries of
Continental capitals. Of the eight copies that are or were in England
one is in the British Museum, and two form part of the well-known
collection formed in the first half of the last century by the late Sir
Thomas Phillipps, Bt., a bibliophile as wealthy as he was discerning.
Of these two MSS., No. 11,592 is an incomplete late copy of little
value; but the other MS., 10,298, is on the other hand a treasure
of great value. Of all the Continental and English copies that the
writer has examined this one contains, next to those in MS. 616, the
finest miniatures. It is less carefully written, and there are some
variations, but nothing of importance so far as is known,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
though it has never been carefully collated with the best French
copies.</p>

<p>The British Museum copy of <i>Gaston Phoebus</i>, catalogued
as Addit. MS. 27,699, is on vellum, quarto, written in the first half
of the fifteenth century. The miniatures are by an indifferent hand,
and have been left in an unfinished state, the miniaturist having
apparently expended most of his time, and nearly all his bright colours
and shining gold, upon the diapering of the backgrounds. It was bought
at the Yemeniz Sale in Paris, in May 1867, for something less than
£400. The Ashburnham Library contained two copies, both early ones,
and of these MS. App. 179 is interesting on account of an hitherto
unknown treatise on hawking and birds being added at the end of the
hunting book, which is incomplete, and the spaces at the head of each
chapter for the usual miniatures are left blank. It was bought at the
fourth Ashburnham Sale in May 1899 by the writer. ¶ Of the copy which
Werth and Lavallée quote as being in the possession of a Cambridge
Library, it is regrettable that no information could be obtained by
them or by myself. As a rule the lot of the student making researches
of this sort in English libraries, always excepting, of course, the
British Museum and the Bodleian, is not a happy one. Not only is
study in the libraries discouraged, and letters of inquiry are left
unanswered, but valuable MSS. seem to get mislaid, lost, or stolen,
rather more frequently than should be. The two remaining copies of
<i>Gaston Phoebus</i> in this country, one being in a public museum,
the other in a well-known ducal library, have shared this fate, and
their whereabouts are unknown. The latter copy must have been a very
beautiful MS., for it is described in Dibdin’s <i>Decameron</i>, Vol.
III, p. 478, and was bought in 1815 for £161, then a large sum, by
Loché; and according to Werth (<i>Altfranzösische Jagdlehrbücher</i>,
1889, p. 70) it was, when he wrote, in the Duke of Devonshire’s
library, from which, however, it seems to have disappeared, for no
trace of it can be found. Curiously enough, this fate is shared by yet
another valuable hunting MS., which for the English student has even
greater interest, namely, one of the few existing copies (nineteen all
told) of the Duke of York’s translation of <i>Gaston Phoebus</i>, which
has disappeared from a well-known nobleman’s library. ¶ In conclusion,
it is necessary to say a few words respecting the subject matter of the
MS. just mentioned, for many erroneous impressions regarding it are
abroad. <i>Gaston Phoebus</i> deals with some animals that were not
found in England in Plantagenet times, <i>e.g.</i> the reindeer, the
ibex and chamois, and the bear. Hence when Edward, second Duke of York,
who filled the position of Master of Game at the court of his cousin,
Henry IV, made a translation of his famous contemporary’s hunting book,
he took only those parts of it which related to game and dogs found
in England, and added five original chapters, calling the whole ‘The
Master of Game.’ This book is the oldest hunting book in English, but
has never been published. The writer’s reproduction of it, illustrated
by photogravure copies of the illuminations in the Paris Codex MS.
616, some of which are reproduced in the present article, is now going
through the press.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It will, it is hoped, fill a gap in English
hunting literature, and remove numerous misconceptions concerning this
subject.</p>

the books of the Spedale di San Paolo, at Florence, is a volume
marked on the cover ‘Testimenti,’ and lettered ‘B.’ It contains a
record of all wills between the years 1399 and 1526 under which the
hospital in any way benefited; and on fol. 16 <i>recto</i> is the
following entry: ‘Alexo di Baldovinecto Baldovinetti has this day,
the 23rd of March, 1499, made a donation to our hospital of all his
goods, personal and real, after his death, with obligation that the
hospital support Mea, his servant, so long as she live: [the deed was]
engrossed by Ser Piero di Leonardo da Vinci, notary of Florence, on
the day aforesaid.’ ‘Alexo died on the last day of August, 1499; and
was buried in his tomb in San Lorenzo; and the hospital remained the
heirs of his goods. May God pardon him his sins!’<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> ¶ Milanese, who
quotes this ‘ricordo’ textually, though not without some slight errors,
in his notes to Vasari, states that the volume in which it occurs is
preserved in the Archivio di Stato at Florence; whereas the archives of
the hospital are now in the ‘Archivio’ of Santa Maria Nuova, San Paolo
having been united to the latter hospital by the Grand Duke Pietro
Leopoldo, c. 1783.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> ¶ At first sight, this ‘ricordo’ would not seem
to bear out the story which Vasari tells of Alesso and his dealings
with the authorities of San Paolo. It states only that Alesso made a
donation to the hospital of all his worldly goods after his death,
upon the condition that his faithful servant, Mea, was to be lodged,
clad, and fed, during her life; whereas Vasari, on the contrary, states
that the painter himself became an inmate of San Paolo. ‘Alesso,’ he
says, ‘lived eighty years; and when he began to grow old, desirous
of being able to attend to the studies of his profession with a quiet
mind, he, as many men often do, entered the Hospital of San Paolo:
and in order, perhaps, that he might be received the more willingly,
and be better treated (though it might, indeed, have happened by
chance), he caused a great chest to be brought into his rooms, in the
hospital; acting as if a goodly sum of money were therein: whereupon
the master and the other ministrants of the hospital, believing that
this was so, bestowed on him the greatest kindness in the world; since
they knew that he had made a donation to the hospital, of whatever
was found in his possession at his death. But when Alesso died, only
drawings, cartoons, and a little book which set forth how to make the
tesserae for mosaic, together with the stucco and the method of working
them, were found therein.’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> ¶ The apparent discrepancy between
the ‘ricordo’ in the books of San Paolo and Vasari’s account led me
to search, and not without success, for the deed by which Alesso’s
property passed to the hospital. I found that both the name of the
notary and the date of the execution of the instrument were incorrectly
given in the ‘ricordo’ cited above. The instrument was engrossed by
Ser Piero di Antonio di Ser Piero da Vinci, the father of Leonardo da
Vinci, and executed on March 16, 1497–8. By this deed Alesso, <i>ex
titulo et causa donationis</i>, ‘irrevocably gave and bequeathed
during his life-time, to the Hospital of the Pinzocheri of the third
order of St. Francis, otherwise called the Hospital of San Pagholo,
and to the poor of Christ living in the said hospital for the time
being,’ etc., ‘all his goods, real and personal, present and future,
wherever situate or existent,’ etc., reserving to himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span> ‘the use and
usufruct of the said goods,’ etc., ‘for the term of his natural life.’
The ‘rogiti’ of Ser Piero da Vinci for the year 1498 have not been
preserved among the ‘protocols’ of that notary now in the Archivio di
Stato at Florence; and so it is no longer possible to say under what
conditions, if any, the donation was made: but it is to be presumed
upon the evidence of the ‘ricordo’ cited above, that it entailed the
obligation on the part of the hospital, to maintain Mea, his servant,
during her life. ¶ On October 17, 1498, Alesso executed what was
technically known as a ‘renuntiatio,’ which was likewise engrossed by
Ser Piero da Vinci. This second instrument, which begins by reciting
the former deed of donation in the terms quoted above, sets forth how,
on that day, Alesso, ‘by reason of lawful and reasonable causes of
motion influencing, as they assert, his mind, and by his mere, free,
and proper will,’ etc., ‘renounced the said use and usufruct, expressly
reserved to himself in the aforesaid donation, and freely remitted and
released the said use and usufruct to the said hospital, and to the
poor of Christ dwelling in the said hospital,’ etc. The text of this
document, which is preserved in the Archivio di Stato at Florence,
is printed at length at the end of this article.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It allows us to
draw but one conclusion; namely, that when the painter executed the
deed of donation on March 16, 1497–8, he had been left without wife
or children; and that he anticipated but two contingencies against
which he would provide after his death—the health of his soul and
the maintenance of his faithful servant, Mea. ¶ Alesso had married
late in life. It appears from the ‘Portata al Catasto,’ returned by
him in 1470, that he was still unmarried at that time, and that he
was possessed of no real property, but rented a house in the ‘popolo’
of San Lorenzo, in Florence, described in his later ‘Denunzie,’ as
being in the Via dell’&#160;Ariento, at the Canto de’ Gori.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In another
‘Denunzia’ returned in 1480, Alesso thus describes his family:—‘Alesso
Baldovinetti, aforesaid, aged 60, painter; Monna Daria, his wife, aged
45; Mea, his maid-servant, aged 13.’ As a matter of fact, Alesso was
63 years of age, having been born on October 14, 1427, Milanesi, by
the way, in his notes to Vasari, gives the name of his, Alesso’s wife,
as Diana, in error for Daria.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> According to the same ‘Denunzia,’
the painter was at that time possessed of a parcel of land of twelve
staiora, situate in the ‘popolo’ of Santa Maria a Quinto, and another
parcel of seven staiora, in the same ‘popolo,’ the latter having been
bought in 1479, with a part of his wife’s dowry. It is, therefore,
probable that he had not long been married at that time.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It appears
from a yet later ‘Denunzia’ on which the ‘Decima’ of 1498 was assessed,
though the return itself was probably drawn up in 1495, that he
possessed, in addition to the two parcels of land in the ‘popolo’ of
Santa Maria a Quinto, a third parcel of over eleven staiora, in the
adjoining ‘popolo’ of San Martino a Sesto, on the road to Prato. He
was still living at that time in the same house at the Canto de’ Gori;
and he also enjoyed the rents of two shops, with dwellinghouses above,
which had been made over to him for the term of his natural life,
by the Consuls of the Arte dei Mercanti, on February 26, 1483–4, in
payment of his ‘magistero e esercitio et trafficho,’ in having restored
the mosaics of the Baptistery of San Giovanni.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> ¶ The Spedale di
San Paolo, of which the beautiful loggia, with its ornaments by Andrea
della Robbia, still remains on the Piazza of Santa Maria Novella, was
originally a hospital for the care of the sick; and as such it is
mentioned in a document of 1208.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> From the time that St. Francis
himself is said to have lodged at San Paolo, the hospital appears to
have been administered by Franciscans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span> called in the records ‘Fratres
tertii Ordinis de Penitentia S. Pauli.’ During the fourteenth century,
the house underwent certain reforms; and in 1398 it was decreed by the
Signoria, ‘that the place was to be no longer a hospital, but a house
of Frati Pinzocheri of the third order.’<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Notwithstanding, the
members of the community continued to devote themselves to the care
of the sick; and a papal brief of 1452 directs that the revenues of
the house were to be set apart for the infirm.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> At an early period
in the history of San Paolo, mention occurs of Pinzochere, that is to
say, women attached to the community, no doubt for the service of the
hospital; but unlike the men of the house, who are invariably called
Frati Pinzocheri, they were not dignified by the title of ‘Monache’:
from this Stefano Rosselli infers that they originally had no share
in its government.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Owing, however, to some cause which is not
very clear, the Frati Pinzocheri appear to have died out towards the
latter part of the fifteenth century, leaving the women in possession
of the hospital. From evidence that Rosselli and Richa adduce, it
seems that in 1497 San Paolo was controlled and administered entirely
by Pinzochere; and in the document of 1499, cited below, it is called
‘lo spedale di pizichora del terzo ordjne dj san franchesco.’<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
From this we must conclude that, when Alesso renounced the use and
enjoyment of his property on October 17, 1498, he entered the hospital
of San Paolo, not as a member of the community, but as a sick man who
sought nothing more on earth than to be tended during the brief span
of life that was left to him. He died ten months later, on August 29,
1499, and was buried in his own tomb in San Lorenzo.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The hospital
of San Paolo probably inherited, along with Alesso’s other property,
all his cartoons and drawings, as Vasari asserts: they, certainly,
came into the possession of his books and papers, as we know. The
little treatise on the art of Mosaic has long been lost; but Milanesi
has stated in a well-known passage in his Vasari, that the autograph
manuscript of certain ‘Ricordi’ of Alesso Baldovinetti still existed
in his time, in the Archivio of Santa Maria Nuova, among the books of
the hospital of San Paolo. He adds that these ‘<i>Ricordi</i> were
published at Lucca in 1868, by Dr. Giovanni Pierotti, <i>per le nozze
Bongi e Ranalli</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Few of those innumerable, little pamphlets
with which Italians, learned and unlearned, delight to celebrate the
marriages of their patrons, friends, or relatives, are more difficult
to find than the little brochure of ten leaves, in a green paper
wrapper, to which Milanesi alludes. The title page runs thus: ‘Ricordi
di Alesso Baldovinetti, pittore fiorentino del secolo xv. Lucca.
Tipografia Landi. 1868.’ Unfortunately only a portion of Baldovinetti’s
manuscript is given in this pamphlet. The extracts, which fill less
than a half of its twenty pages, are partly given in the text, and
partly in an abstract, of the original. The rest of the pamphlet is
filled with the introductory preface and notes of Dr. Pierotti. ¶
It is now some years ago since I first made an attempt to find the
original manuscript of these ‘Ricordi,’ in the Archivio of Santa Maria
Nuova, only to discover that I was not the first student of Florentine
painting to search in vain for the volume. Whether it had been borrowed
by Pierotti, or merely mislaid, or in what way it had disappeared, no
one could tell me. Not long after this attempt, however, I chanced
upon what proved to be a clue to its history. While searching among
the ‘Carte Milanesi,’ the voluminous manuscript collections which the
famous commentator of Vasari left to the Communal Library of Siena, I
came across a series of extracts from the ‘Ricordi’ of Baldovinetti,
in the handwriting of Milanesi, with the title: ‘Estratto del libro
dei Ricordi di Alesso Baldovinetti autografo <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>essitente nell’
Archivio dello Spedale di Santa Maria Nuova di Firenze.—Libri dello
Spedale di San Paolo, 12 Febb<sup>o</sup>. 1850.’ On comparing these extracts
with Pierotti’s pamphlet, I found that the two copies agreed word for
word with one another. It was evident that Pierotti had made use of
Milanesi’s manuscript (indeed, he owns as much in his concluding note),
and that he may never have seen the original manuscript. ¶ Last autumn,
having occasion to make some researches in the Archivio of Santa Maria
Nuova, with my friend Sir Domenic Colnaghi, for his ‘Dictionary of
Florentine Painters,’ I took the opportunity of renewing my search
for the missing volume. On the top shelf of one of the presses
which contain the books and papers of the hospital of San Paolo,
I came across a ‘filza’ labelled ‘Libri Diversi,’ and filled with
miscellaneous account-books of the hospital, chiefly of the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries. Among these was a small, upright book of
forty-seven leaves, bound in a parchment cover which was inscribed:—</p>

<p>On the recto of the first leaf was written: ‘1470. In this book I will
keep a record of all the expenses that I shall incur in the chapel of
the High Altar of Santa Trinita, namely of gold, blue, green, lake,
with all other colours and expenses that shall be incurred on behalf
of the said chapel; and so we may remain in agreement [I and] Messer
Bongiani Gianfigliazi, the commissioner of the work, and the patron of
the said chapel, as appears by a writing which I hold, subscribed by
his own hand.’ ¶ Fol. 2 <i>tergo</i>, and fol. 3 <i>recto</i>, were
filled with entries relating to the purchase of colours and other
materials for the work of the chapel, and fol. 3 <i>tergo</i> contained
two further entries in the same hand; after which was written, in
a different hand: ‘Here follow the records of the hospital of the
Pinzochere of the third order of St. Francis, written by Giovanni
di Ser Antonio Vianizzi.’ The remainder of the book was filled with
entries relating to the hospital of San Paolo, the first of which
recorded a payment of twenty-three lire, made by the hospital on
October 19, 1499, to Luca d’Alesso Baldovinetti. On comparing the
‘Ricordi’ relating to Santa Trinita, with the ‘Portata al Catasto,’
returned by Alesso in 1471, it was clearly evident that both documents
were in the handwriting of the painter. Of the ‘Portata al Catasto,’
returned by Alesso in 1480, two copies exist in the same hand; but they
do not appear to have been written by the painter himself, although
Milanesi has reproduced a portion of one of them, in his ‘Scrittura di
Artisti Italiani,’ Florence, 1876, Vol. 1, No. 74, as a specimen of his
handwriting. ¶ What is more, this manuscript, which I may call ‘Libro
B,’ throws a light upon the nature of the missing volume, ‘Libro A.’
In the case of ‘Libro B,’ what undoubtedly happened was, that the good
Pinzochere, on looking over Alesso’s property after his death, found an
account-book of which only the first three leaves had been used. With
a proper spirit of economy, they determined to make use of the rest of
the book for the accounts of their hospital: but instead of tearing
out the leaves containing Alesso’s ‘Ricordi,’ they fortunately allowed
them to stand; their procurator adding the note I have cited above.
The same thing probably happened in the case of ‘Libro A.’ From the
extracts that Milanesi made, it appears that Alesso’s ‘Ricordi’ only
filled some sixteen pages of a volume, that cannot well have contained
fewer leaves than ‘Libro B.’ With this clue to its discovery, I leave
my friends and rivals in Florence to continue the search for a volume,
whose loss every genuine student of Italian painting must regret. ¶ The
history of the Cappella Maggiore of Santa Trinita affords a curious
instance of the tardy process by which many of the Florentine churches
and their chapels were brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span> to completion. The present church
of Santa Trinita was begun <i>c.</i> 1250, but many of the lateral
chapels remained unfinished until the fifteenth century, and among
them the Cappella Maggiore. On November 1, 1371, the abbot of Santa
Trinita, <i>inter missarum solepnia</i>, made an appeal to many of
the chief parishioners, who had assembled for mass, to contribute to
the expenses necessary for the erection of the Cappella Maggiore.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
The work appears to have proceeded very slowly, since it is on record
that the chapel was but half built in the year 1463. In order to bring
it to completion, the abbot, having assembled the parishioners in the
church, gave notice that since money was wanting to finish the work,
licence to do so would be granted to the family that was able and
willing to undertake the expense; and accordingly on February 4 of
the same year, the patronage of the chapel was granted by acclamation
of the parishioners, to Messer Bongianni Gianfigliazzi and his
descendants.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> ¶ The Gianfigliazzi were an ancient Florentine family,
of no little repute in the conduct of affairs and arms during the last
two centuries of the republic. Ugolino Verino celebrates them in his
Latin poem, ‘De Illustratione Urbis Florentiae’:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container s5">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Non genus externum est: agro venere paterno,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Janfiliazze, tui, si vera est fama, priores.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Protulit illustres equites generosa propago.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>According to Piero Monaldi, the Gianfigliazzi were descended and took
their name from one ‘Ioannes filius Acci,’ who is named in a treaty
concluded between the Sienese and Florentines in the year 1201.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
Besides knights of Malta and Santo Spirito, this family boasted of ten
gonfaloniers of the republic, and thirty priors; the first of whom held
office in 1345. Gherardo Gianfigliazzi was gonfalonier in 1462; and
Messer Bongianni, his brother, in 1467, and again in 1470. The latter,
‘magnificus miles’ as he is styled in documents, was a ‘cavalier spron
d’oro,’ and famous in his day as a leader of the Florentine forces.
He was several times created ambassador of the Florentine republic,
and one of the Dieci di Balia. In 1471 he was one of the six ‘orators’
sent to felicitate Sixtus IV on his election to the papacy; and in 1483
he was appointed ‘commessario’ in the war against the Genoese, which
ended in the capture of Sarzana. Alesso was not the only famous artist
which this family patronized. Their shield of arms, carved with a lion
rampant, by Desiderio da Settignano, is still to be seen on the front
of their palace on the Lung’ arno Corsini, at Florence.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> ¶ Giuseppe
Richa states that the deed granting the patronage of the Cappella
Maggiore of Santa Trinita to the Gianfigliazzi, was engrossed by Ser
Pierozzo Cerbini on February 13, 1463–4, which we may well believe;<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
but he adds that the ‘ius patronale’ was vested in the persons of
Messer Bongianni and Messer Gherardo.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The latter statement,
however, would seem to be incorrect, for Gherardo was already dead at
that time, as we learn from the inscription on the sepulchral slab
(one of the most beautiful of its kind in Florence), which is still
to be seen on the floor of the chapel, but now partly covered by a
choir-organ:</p>

<p>Messer Bongianni appears to have proceeded at once with the work
of finishing the chapel. His share of the work may yet be made out:
the vaulting, with its heavy roll ribs, too large for the corbels on
which they rest, was clearly erected by him. The corbels themselves
probably date from the thirteenth century. Furthermore, he constructed
the large window of two round-headed lights, and an a ‘occhio,’ or
circular light, above, which is still to be seen in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>head of
the chapel. The structure being completed, he next turned to the
decoration, which he began by filling the lights of the window with
painted glass. Alesso Baldovinetti enters, in his ‘Ricordi,’ Libro
A, that ‘Lionardo di Bartolommeo, surnamed Lastra, and Giovanni di
Andrea, glazier, owe me this 14th day of February, 1465[-6], lire 120;
which moneys are for the painting of a window placed in the Cappella
Maggiore of Santa Trinita; and Bongianni di Bongianni Gianfigliazzi has
ordered this window to be executed by the said Lastra and Giovanni,
master-glaziers; and I, Alesso, have designed and painted it for them,
at the rate of forty soldi the square braccio: the ‘occhio’ above
being estimated with the said window, in the said sum, and according
to the said measure.‘<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It appears from the ‘Trattato’ of Cennino
Cennini that it was the common practice of the ‘maestri di finestre’
in Florence in the fifteenth century not only to employ painters to
design cartoons for their windows, but also to paint the design upon
the glass. The ‘maestro di finistre,’ says Cennini, ‘will come to you
with the measure of his window, both breadth and length. You will take
as many sheets of paper glued together as will be necessary for your
window; and you will draw your figure first in charcoal, afterwards
you will outline it in ink, having shaded your figure as completely
as if you were drawing it on panel. Then the master-glazier takes
this design and spreads it out on a desk or board, large and even,
and according as he wishes to colour the draperies of the figure, so,
piece by piece, he cuts the glasses, and gives you a colour made of
copper filings, well ground; and with this colour, piece by piece,
you proceed with a little pencil of minever, having a good point, to
contrive your shadows, making the joins of the folds and other parts
of your figure agree, one piece of glass with another, just as the
master-glazier has cut and put them together; and with this colour you
are able, without exception, to shade on every sort of glass.’<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> ¶
In 1616, the glass designed and painted by Alesso, ‘being all spoiled,
broken, and patched, in such a manner that it yielded no light, except
where there was no wire-screen,’ the whole of the lights were reglazed
anew, at the joint expense of the monastery and the patrons of the
chapel.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The beautiful stonework of the window, however, designed
in the classic taste of the time, with finely-wrought pilasters at the
jambs and mullion, was restored and filled with modern stained-glass
during the recent restoration of the church, in 1890–7. ¶ It appears
from the ‘Ricordi,’ Libro A, of Alesso Baldovinetti, that the painter
gave designs for several windows to the ‘maestri di finestre.’ In
1472, he designed an Annunciation to be executed in glass for the
cathedral church of San Martino, at Lucca; and in 1481, he designed a
window for the church of Sant’ Agostino, at Arezzo.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> These windows
have perished, but there still remains in Florence a painted window
which was undoubtedly executed from a cartoon by Alesso. This window,
which, so far as I am aware, has never been ascribed to him, is above
the altar of the Pazzi chapel, in the first cloister of Santa Croce.
[Plate I.] It consists of two lights, a lower circular-headed light
containing a full-length figure of St. Andrew, the patron saint of the
chapel, with the arms of the Pazzi below; and an upper round window,
or ‘occhio,’ containing a half-length figure of God the Father. This
window affords a good example of the use of the pure and brilliant
colours which the Florentine ‘maestri di finestre’ employed in the
fifteenth century, and which to our northern eyes are apt to appear
crude and too little wrought upon. But seen, as such windows were
doubtless intended to be seen, with the full power of the Italian
sun upon them, their colours become fused, and take that jewel-like
quality which is essentially distinctive of the finest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span> painted-glass.
The figure of St. Andrew is draped in a golden leaf-green robe, lined
with a smalt blue, and worn over an underrobe of a warm and brilliant
purple. The frieze of the niche behind the figure is of a colder
purple; the capitals of a madder tint; the cupola of a smalt blue; and
the sky in the background of a full ultramarine. The figure of God
the Father in the ‘occhio’ above, wears a golden purple vest, and a
mantle of smalt blue; and the curtains of a madder purple, lined with
green, which are drawn apart, reveal a skyey background of ultramarine
behind the figure. During the recent restoration of the Pazzi chapel,
this window was repaired, and several missing pieces of the glass made
good. These repairs are especially noticeable in the ultramarine glass.
¶ The high altar of Santa Trinita was originally placed immediately
below the window, in the head of the Cappella Maggiore. Its beautiful
marble frontal, carved with the symbol of the Trinity in relief, was
found during the recent restoration of the church, in the Cappella
della Pura, in Santa Maria Novella, and has once more been put to
its original use. For this altar Alesso, as he records in Libro A,
received the commission from Messer Bongianni, on April 11, 1470, to
paint an altar-piece, in which was to be a Trinity with two saints,
namely, St. Benedict and St. John Gualbert, and angels. He finished it
on February 8, 1471, and received eighty-nine gold florins in payment
for the work.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In 1569, the high altar was brought forward, and
placed below the arch of the Cappella Maggiore; and the choir which
anciently lay before the high altar, in the body of the church, was
reconstructed in the chapel, behind the altar. In 1671, the crucifix of
St. John Gualbert was brought from San Miniato, and placed upon the new
high altar; and Alesso’s altar-piece was left hanging in its original
position, below the window of the choir, where it was to be seen when
Don Averardo Niccolini collected his notices of Santa Trinita, towards
the middle of the seventeenth century.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> At a later time the picture
was removed into the sacristy; and finally, upon the suppression of
the monastery in 1808, it was taken to the Florentine Academy, where
it is still preserved, No. 159. [Plate II.] It is painted on a panel
measuring 7 ft. 8½ ins. in height, and 9 ft. 1¾ ins. in length. God
the Father is seated in the centre of the composition, in the midst
of a glory of seraphim, supporting the cross on which the figure or
Christ is hanging. The Holy Ghost, in the form of a dove, hovers above
the crucifix; and at the foot of the cross, which rests upon the
earth, is the skull of Adam. In the lower left-hand corner kneels St.
Benedict, in the habit of his order; and on the opposite side of the
picture kneels St. John Gualbert. In the upper corners, two angels
draw back a curtain embroidered with pearls; while other angels hover
around, against the skyey background. Dry, almost unpleasing as a
whole, and with little or nothing of that delicate feeling for sensuous
beauty which distinguishes Alesso’s early works, this altar-piece
is, nevertheless, one of the most remarkable productions extant of
Florentine painting in the fifteenth century. In execution, it shows a
mastery of technique to which few of Alesso’s contemporaries attained.
The draperies, for instance, are wrought with a richness of colour and
texture which recalls the work of some great Fleming. In conception too
severely understood, in presentation too precisely wrought out, and
with too exacting a definition, this altar-piece seems to forestall
something of that profoundly intellectual rendering of constructed
form, which Michael Angelo afterwards carried to its height in the
fresco of the Last Judgement. Certainly, there are few more striking
instances of the manner to which the Florentine painters of the
fifteenth century developed the technique and science of painting.</p>

Exhibition included a number of other works attributed to Memlinc.
Three of these are supposed to have been executed in his early years:
the Passion of Saint Sebastian (69), belonging to the Brussels
Museum; the triptych with the Deposition of Christ in the centre, and
Saints James and Christopher (92), formerly at Liphook in the Heath
collection, now the property of M. R. von Kaufmann; and the Blessed
Virgin and Child with a donor protected by Saint Anthony. The first
of these was probably painted by a follower of Dirk Bouts; the second
by an imitator of Bouts and Memlinc; the third only has any claim to
be considered the work of Memlinc; the date 1472, inscribed in the
background, is certainly modern, but probably copied from the frame
when this was discarded. The Blessed Virgin and Child (78), lent by
Mr. A. Thiem, is a school picture in not very good condition; another
(83) belonging to Baron P. Bethune, having long served as the lid of
a miller’s flour box, has very little of the original work left. A
Madonna enthroned with two angels (82) entirely overpainted, lent by
Mrs. Stephenson Clarke, and another belonging to the Museum of Woerlitz
(29), are like similar pictures in the Museum at Vienna and in the
possession of the Duke of Westminster, works probably painted after
Memlinc’s death from his patterns by Louis Boels. The three large
panels from the monastery of Najera (84), belonging to the Antwerp
Museum, are fine decorative works painted about 1490 by an imitator of
Memlinc and Van Eyck. As to the Annunciation lent by Prince Radziwill
(85), said by Dr. Waagen to have been painted in 1482, I should,
looking at the colour and execution, think it at least twenty years
later, and am convinced that Memlinc never had anything whatever to do
with it. Mr. Hulin calls it Memlinc’s most perfect composition; Dr.
Friedländer, ‘an extremely original composition of remarkable delicacy
of sentiment and execution’ (<i>von höchst eigenartiger Komposition
und besonderer Feinheit in Empfindung und Durchführung</i>); while
a writer in the <i>Athenaeum</i> of September 20 says: ‘In conception
it belongs entirely to the master, and the composition is as fine
and original as anything to be found in his work,’ and thinks that
‘it was <i>a beautiful and new conceit</i> thus to represent the
Virgin as sinking down tremblingly at the angel’s word, but held by
the supporting arms of two other attendant angels who look up to her
with reassuring smiles.’ Now it is certain that Memlinc, far from
being an innovator and an inventor of what the writer properly calls
new conceits, was a faithful follower of ecclesiastical tradition,
and would never have dreamt of introducing into the representation
of this mystery these two sentimental and affected angels. No doubt
the Gospel says that Mary was troubled at the words of the angel, but
there is nothing to warrant this impertinent addition. The fact is that
the beautiful long waving line of the Virgin’s robe with its sudden
returning lines has made these critics shut their eyes to these points,
which I think are by themselves sufficient evidence that the picture is
the work of a sixteenth-century innovator. As to the six panels (176)
lent by the Strassburg Museum, it is an outrage to suggest that Memlinc
was their author. ¶ After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span> Memlinc, the greatest master who worked
at Bruges was another foreigner, Gerard son of John, son of David, a
native of Oudewater in South Holland, who in all probability learnt
his art either at Haarlem or under Dirk Bouts at Louvain. He came to
Bruges at the end of 1483, and was admitted into the Guild of Saint
Luke as free master on January 14, 1484. Although we have no written
evidence as to his history previous to that date, yet certain details
in his works make it almost certain that he had travelled in Italy
after the termination of his apprenticeship. Bruges still possesses
the earliest works by him of which the authenticity is established;
these with a number of others by his followers not only afforded an
excellent opportunity for studying the variations in his manner, but
showed the great influence he exercised over his contemporaries and
followers. In 1488 Gerard David was commissioned to paint two pictures
by the magistrates elected by the three members of Flanders to succeed
those who had been deposed after the imprisonment of Maximilian; they
were intended by them to commemorate the execution of the judge Peter
Lanchals and other members of the late administration who, having been
found guilty of corruption and malversation, had been condemned to
death and executed. Gerard, however, instead of painting the history of
Lanchals, took for his theme an analogous subject originally recorded
by Herodotus, which he probably drew from the then much better known
works of Valerius Maximus. By so doing he avoided the resentment of
the friends of the deposed magistrates, while the subject chosen was
equally well adapted to recall to the sitting magistrates that they
must be honest and impartial. In the first of the two panels (121),
which we reproduce (as the frontispiece of this number), Cambyses,
accompanied by his court, is represented entering the hall of justice
and ordering the arrest of the unjust judge Sisamnes. In the background
Sisamnes is seen at the porch of his house receiving a bag of money
from a suitor. The groups of nude children and the garlands of fruit
and flowers, the earliest instance of the occurrence of such details
in a Netherlandish picture, must have been copied from Venetian or
Florentine pictures, and the two Medicean cameos are almost proofs of
a visit to Florence; one of these, the Judgement of Marsyas by Apollo,
is represented as a breast ornament worn by Lucretia Tornabuoni (?)
in the portrait of that lady by Botticelli in the Städel Institute
at Frankfort. It is interesting to note that the square seen in the
background is an almost exact representation of the Square of St. John
at Bruges. The flaying of Sisamnes (122) is an extremely realistic
picture vigorously painted with wonderful finish. The composition
and pose of the figures in both scenes remind one of Carpaccio, the
heads have a great deal of character, and the hands are admirably
modelled. For the two pictures, which were not completed until 1498,
Gerard received in three instalments the sum of £14 10s. ¶ The
National Gallery contains two pictures painted between 1500 and 1510,
both formerly in the Cathedral of Saint Donatian at Bruges, the one
an altar-piece executed for Richard De Visch Van der Capelle, who
held the office of cantor in that church; the other, the dexter wing
of a triptych painted for Bernardine Salviati, a canon of the same
cathedral. These of course were not at Bruges, but I mention them here
because they form a connecting link with the triptych representing the
Baptism of Christ (123), of which the centre and the inner face of the
shutters were painted before 1502, and the outer in 1508. The next work
in order of date, and in my opinion David’s masterpiece, is the picture
(124) presented by him in 1509 to the convent of the Carmelite nuns of
Sion at Bruges, and now in the Rouen Museum; it represents the Blessed
Virgin and Child surrounded by virgin saints and two angels, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
one playing a mandoline, the other a viola, whilst at the extreme
ends in the background the painter has represented himself and his
young wife. The composition is not quite original; Memlinc had already
painted for John Du Celier a small Sacra Conversazione now in the
Louvre, and another artist who has not as yet been identified had
executed in 1489, for the Guild of Saints Mary Magdalene, Katherine,
and Barbara, an altar-piece (114) which doubtless suggested not only
the composition of this picture but the mode of characterizing the
saints. The author of this earlier work, if one may judge by its
colouring, was probably accustomed to design tapestries; most of the
figures are exceedingly plain and wanting in expression, whereas in
Gerard’s picture the colouring is harmonious and the figures remarkable
for beauty of expression, the angels being amongst the most charming
conceptions realized by the school.

<p>The large triptych (125) lent by
M. de Somzée, with life-size figures of Saint Anne with the Blessed
Virgin and Child in the centre, and Saints Nicholas and Anthony of
Padua on the shutters, painted for some Spanish church, is a late work
inferior in execution to those already mentioned. Six other panels
with scenes from the lives of the two saints, said to have been the
predella of this altar-piece, not exhibited, are on the contrary
charming works; they are now in the possession of Lady Wantage. Two
shutters of a triptych (138) with full-length figures of four saints,
lent by Mr. James Simon, of Berlin, appear to me to be authentic
works; the Saints Christopher and Anthony are especially good. ¶ Of
the other eleven works attributed to Gerard by their owners or by
those who have written on the exhibition, I can only say <i>caveat
lector</i>. We know no picture painted by Gerard before 1488 or after
1512, and the variation of style in the works executed between those
dates of which the authenticity is established makes it difficult to
say with certainty that any picture painted at Bruges between 1512
and 1527 is or is not by him, and it is certainly mere guesswork to
attribute to him any pictures of an earlier date than 1488; it is
indeed probable that, being a stranger, he would during his first
four years at Bruges have confined himself to the execution of small
pictures of religious subjects which would meet with a ready sale.
The Adoration of the Magi (135) lent by the Brussels Museum, formerly
supposed to be by John van Eyck, was first attributed to Gerard by Dr.
Scheibler. Dr. Friedländer believes it to be an original work of about
1500, often copied. It was originally in the Premonstratensian abbey
of Saint Michael at Antwerp, and I doubt its being a Bruges picture or
an original composition. The original painting was certainly executed
shortly after 1490 and was copied by the miniaturist who adorned a
Dominican Breviary which was in the possession of Francis de Roias in
Spain before 1497. ¶ The style of the figures and the colouring of the
Annunciation (128) lent by the Museum of Sigmaringen are very much in
Gerard’s manner, and it may possibly be by him; the Städel Museum at
Frankfort contains a copy of these two panels apparently painted by a
Netherlandish artist in the Peninsula or by a Portuguese artist in the
Low Countries, the inscription on the border of the angel’s vestments
being in Portuguese: <i>Modar de Senor</i>. A triptych representing
the Deposition of Christ (126), which though thrice restored, in 1675,
1773, and 1827, is still in fairly good condition, was first included
by me in 1863 among the works by Gerard on the authority of a document
of the year 1675, preserved in the archives of the Confraternity of
the Holy Blood, to which the picture has always belonged. It certainly
differs considerably from the pictures painted by him between 1488 and
1510, and shows a strong influence of Quentin Metsys, and I do not
think that the opinion of two or three modern critics warrants the
rejection of the evidence in its favour. The picture was certainly
painted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span> <i>c.</i> 1520 in Bruges, where several old copies of it
were preserved until the middle of the last century. ¶ A Holy Family
(343) lent by M. Martin Le Roi is an excellent work painted about
the same time, showing even more strongly the influence of Quentin
Metsys, and I have little doubt painted by an Antwerp master. Yet
this is classed by Dr. Friedländer as an excellent work of David’s
later time (<i>Vortreffliches Werk aus der Spätzeit Davids</i>),
although there is neither tradition nor documentary evidence in
favour of this attribution. The Transfiguration (117) belonging to
the church of Our Lady, another work of about the same date, is of
interest as representing an event rarely treated by the early masters
of the Netherlands. The composition shows an Italian influence; the
figures, especially those in the group on the left, that of Gerard;
the colouring is light and cool; the picture has suffered very much
from neglect. The shutters of this altar-piece, not exhibited, were
painted by Peter Pourbus. The lunette (149) lent by Baron de Schickler
is a fine piece, but the types of the figures are unlike any in
Gerard’s authentic works. ¶ Gerard was not only a painter but also a
miniaturist, and as such a member of the Guild of Saint John and the
head of a school of miniaturists. Two specimens of his own work—(129)
Saint John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness and the Baptism of
Christ—and three by his wife, Cornelia Cnoop, were formerly in the
Cistercian abbey of Saint Mary in the Dunes; the three last (130), lent
by Messrs. P. and D. Colnaghi, are here reproduced; they have been
framed as a triptych.</p>

a comparatively few years ago, the literature of science was
almost wholly silent on the subject of the Svastika. Professor Wilson,
of the Smithsonian Institute, writing in the early nineties, sets
forth that in most of the best-known encyclopedias, both European
and American, the word Svastika is not so much as mentioned. It was
indeed, he says, this to him incomprehensible omission, and consequent
admittedly general ignorance, that prompted him to make an exhaustive
study of the subject, and to embody the results of his researches
in what is undoubtedly the standard work on Svastika at the present
time. Yet even Professor Wilson, while giving to his readers the great
mass of evidence he has collated, is chary of expressing any definite
opinion as to the origin and significance of this universal symbol. In
this reserve he is doubtless prudent, at least in so far that he has
avoided entering upon a controversy which must probably be endless.
The theories, indeed, that have been presented concerning the origin
and the symbolism of the Svastika are as numerous as they are diverse.
Every kind of suggestion has been made as to its relation to the
most ancient Deities, and as to its typifying of certain qualities.
Various writers have regarded it as being the emblem, respectively,
of Zeus and of Baal, of the Sun God, of the Sun itself as a God, and
of the Sun chariot. Of Agni (the Ignis of the Romans) the fire God,
and of Indra the rain God. In the estimation of others, again, it is
typical of the sky and of the sky God; and finally of the Deity of all
Deities, the great God, the maker and ruler of the universe. Again, it
has been held to symbolize light and the God of light, and the forked
lightning, as a manifestation of that Deity; and yet again, according
to some, from its intimate association with the Lotus, it has been
regarded as the emblem of the God of water. That it is the oldest
known Aryan symbol is hardly in dispute. There are writers who have
announced their conviction that it represents Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva,
the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer. Certainly it appears
in the footprints of Buddha, engraved upon the living rock of Indian
mountains; equally certainly
it stood for the Jupiter Tonans and Pluvius of the Latins, and for
the Thor of the Scandinavians, though that it represented a variety
of the ‘Thor hammer’ is now considered to be disproved. Many have
attributed a Phallic meaning to it, or, regarding it as the symbol of
the female, have claimed that it represents the generative principles
of mankind, while its appearance on the person of certain Goddesses,
Artemis, Hera, Demeter, Astarte, and the Chaldean ‘Nana,’ the leaden
Goddess from Hissarlik, has caused it to be claimed as a sign of
fecundity. But, as Professor Wilson points out, and as every other
writer has allowed, whatever else the Svastika may have stood for, and
however many meanings it may have had, it was always, if not primarily,
ornamental. It may have been used with any or all and other than the
above significations, but it was always ornamental as well.

<p>But in
whatever other connexion it may have been employed, it was invariably,
and still is to-day, an auspicious sign. It is still used by the common
people of India, of China, and of Japan, as a sign of ‘long life, good
wishes, and good fortune.’ Among many North American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span> Indian tribes
it is called ‘the luck,’ and the men wear it embroidered on their
garters, and the women on the borders of their skirts; and in ancient
times it was wont to be embroidered in quills on the bags in which
they carried their medicinal herbs. In Thibet it is a not uncommon
mode of tattooing; and in this connexion it is interesting to note
that Higgins in his ‘Anacalypsis’ says, concerning the origin of the
cross, that the official name for the Governor of Thibet comes from
the ancient Thibetan name for cross, the original spelling of which
is “Lamh.” Davenport corroborates this view in his “Aphrodisiaco.”
There is, according to Balfour, despite Mr. Gandhi’s contradictions of
Colonel Cunningham, a sect in Thibet who receive their name from this
symbol. They are the ‘Tao-sse’ of the Chinese. The founder of this
doctrine is said to have flourished <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> 604 to 523. They were
rationalists who held that peace of mind and contentment were the only
objects worthy of attainment in this life. They assumed the name of
Tirthakar, or pure-doers. Professor Max Müller, discussing the question
why the sign should have had an auspicious meaning,
mentions that Mr. Thomas, the distinguished oriental numismatist, has
called attention to the fact, that in the long list of the recognized
devices of the twenty-four Jain Tirthankara<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> the sun is absent, but
that while the eighth Tirthankara has the sign of the half moon, the
seventh is marked with a Svastika, <i>i.e.</i> the sun. Here, then, is
clear indication that the Svastika with the ends pointing in the right
direction was originally a symbol of the sun, perhaps of the vernal
sun as opposed to the autumnal sun, the ‘Suavastika,’ and therefore a
natural symbol of light, life, health, and wealth. This ‘Suavastika,’
Max Müller believes, was applied to the Svastika sign
with the ends bent to the left, but with the exception of Burnouf
(‘Des Sciences et Religions’) no one agrees with him. Burnouf supports
his theory (which is, that the word Suavastika is a derivation of the
Svastika, and ought to signify ‘he, who, or that which bears or carries
the Svastika or a species of Svastika’) by the story of Agni (Ignis),
the god of Sacred Fire, as told in the ‘Veda’ (the four sacred books of
the Hindus). ‘The young Queen, the Mother of Fire, carried the Royal
infant mysteriously concealed in her bosom. She was a woman of the
people, whose common name was Arani—that is, the instrument of wood
(the Svastika) from which fire was produced by rubbing.’ Burnouf says
that the origin of the sign is now easy to recognize. It represents the
two pieces of wood which compose the Arani, of which the extremities
were to be retained by the four nails. At the junction of the two
pieces was a fossette or cup-like hole, and there was placed a wooden
upright in the form of a lance (the pramantha), the violent rotation of
which (by whipping after the fashion of the whipping-top) brought forth
fire.</p>

</div>

<p>Zmigrodski agrees with this view; but, as with every other theory
connected with Svastika, it has many opponents. ¶ Professor Dumontier
holds that Svastika is nothing else than a development of the ancient
Chinese characters C. h. e, which carries the idea, according to Count
Goblet D’Alviella (in ‘La Migration des Symboles’), of perfection or
excellence, and signifies the renewal and perpetuity of life. Max
Müller, Waring, and D’Alviella are agreed that neither in Babylonia
nor in Assyria are any traces of Svastika to be found. Ludwig Müller,
however, finds ample evidence of it on Persian coins of the Arsacides
and Sassanides dynasties. ¶ Arsacides was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
name of the Parthian kings whose family name was Arseus. The Arsacidean
kings of Armenia, according to Moses of Chorene, began to reign
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> 130, and ruled until <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 45, when the Armenian
kingdom was extinguished. The Sassanian kings of Persia ruled from
<span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 226 to 641, when the last monarch, Yez-de-jird the Third,
was overthrown by the Mahomedans. This monarchy took its origin when
Artaxerxes (the Greek and Roman way of pronouncing Ardeshir) overthrew
the Parthian dynasty. This prince, Ardeshir Babekan, son of Sassan,
was an officer of King Arsaces Artabanus the Fifth, whom he murdered,
assuming the Persian throne as the first of the Sassanian dynasty. ¶
Ohnefalsch Richter holds the view that although no trace of Svastika
had been found in Phoenicia, yet that travellers to that country had
brought it from the Far East, and had introduced it into Cyprus, and
into Carthage and the north of Africa generally. As against the denial
of it in Assyria, however, is Wilson’s assertion that the three-rayed
design is found on Assyrian coins, as also as a countermark on those of
Alexander, <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> 333 to 323. Professor Sayce,
on the other hand, is of opinion that Svastika was a Hittite symbol which passed by communication
to the Aryans, or to some of their important branches before their
final dispersion took place. The Professor regards it as being fairly
established that the symbol was in more or less common use among the
peoples of the bronze age anterior to either the Chaldeans, Hittites,
or Aryans.

<p>As against all these theories, Major-General Gordon,
writing to Dr. Schliemann in 1896 from the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich,
of which he was then Controller, points out that the Svastika is
obviously Chinese, and that on the breech of a large gun captured in
the Taku Fort in ’61, and at the time of writing lying outside his
office at Woolwich, the same symbol is displayed. Dr. Lockyer, who was
for many years a medical missionary in China, also says that the sign
is thoroughly Chinese. Colonel Sykes, another authority on matters
Chinese, concludes that according to the Chinese authorities, Fa-hiau,
Soung-Young, and Hiuantusang, the ‘doctors of reason,’ Taosee or
followers of the mystic cross were diffused in China and India before
the advent of Sakya in the sixth century <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> (according to
other authorities in the eleventh century <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>), continuing to
Fa-hiau’s time, and that they were professors of qualified Buddhism,
which it is stated was the universal religion of Thibet before Sakya’s
advent, and continued until orthodox Buddhism was introduced in the
ninth century <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> As to this Colonel Tod holds the opinion
that the first Buddha of the four flourished circa <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> 2250.
This was Budh the parent of the lunar race. ¶ The Greeks undoubtedly
connected the symbol with the cult of Apollo, but it seems probable
that the sign came to them from Egypt, where the Tau
which was a cross was anciently a symbol of the generative power, and
afterwards was introduced into the Bacchic mysteries. Such a cross has
been found at Pompeii in a house, in juxtaposition with the Phallus
and with other symbols embodying the same idea. This mystic Tau, or
Standard of the Cross as it has been called, formed just half of the
Labarum,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> or idolatrous war standard of the Pagans. The Labarum
bore at once the crescent and the cross, the crescent as the emblem of
Astarte the Queen of Heaven, and the cross as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span> that of Bacchus. ¶ The
controversy, if so it can be called, will doubtless rage for all time,
but the one essential point remains salient: namely, that the symbol is
admittedly universal, and equally admittedly it is the basis and the
mainstay in one form or another of all conventional decorative design.
It is to be found everywhere in our modern life. In our household
appointments, in our mural decorations, in the shapes and adornment
of articles of our furniture. Even does it come down to us in the
shape of those old irons on houses with which we are all familiar,
and which, though a few persons fondly believe them to be so placed
for the purpose of remedying cracking walls, are regarded by every
right-thinking country person as a protection against lightning and fire.
Unconsciously Svastika permeates our whole existence. We cannot even
sit down to dinner without finding it set before us in some of our
table appointments; and nowhere is the symbol more constantly and
more permanently evident than in oriental rugs and carpets. In every
specimen of these, of whatsoever provenance, and no matter how much
the flowing line of curves may have encroached on the rectilineal
design of convention, the Svastika is traceable. It may not be at
once discovered in the main body of the pattern, though it is always
present, but it is invariably and inevitably to be found in the border,
which it may at once be said is as much an historical asset as is the
central design itself.</p>

<p>Of course throughout the natural working of Time’s processes,
the merging of myths and the blending of conceptions, certain bold
and salient developments, if projected with sufficient force and
persistency, must ever remain paramount. This is the case with the
Svastika and with that other symbol, that of the lotus, with which it
is almost invariably found in conjunction. There are many indeed who
claim that the two symbols are indivisible. Professor Goodyear, no mean
authority, is specially insistent on this point. He holds that it is
the lotus that is the keynote of decoration. The lotus, he contends,
is the Tree of Life, or rather the accepted Tree of Life is really the
lotus in one or another of its many aspects. The spiral scroll, he
urges, comes from the bent sepals of the lotus much exaggerated, which
being squared becomes the Greek fret or meander or key pattern, and
this doubled forms the Svastika. ¶ The Lotus and the Tree of Life will
form the subject of the next article.</p>

is every probability that the current exhibition of early and
modern pictures by Dutch artists will prove to be one of the most
popular which has yet been held at the Guildhall; not, indeed, because
it is of finer quality than its predecessors, but from the fact that
the pictures are well within the grasp of the average man. There is
nothing incomprehensible to those least acquainted with Dutch art,
and there is something that will appeal to all. It must have occurred
to many with regard to pictures of Holland by artists of varying
nationality that only the Dutchman really grasps the subtleties of the
country. All the rest look upon it with alien eyes, and give us but
the external form. They never get behind the veil and infect us with
that indefinable exquisiteness and charm so characteristic of Holland
with its pastoral flats, pollard willows, canals, picturesque craft
and windmills and, most wonderful of all, that delicate atmosphere
softening the harshest lines into a melodious ensemble, and overhead
the immensity of sky, vast in its expanse and with its delicacies
of blues and greys. The finest Dutch landscape painters have always
painted in a minor key; whenever they seek to modulate into the major
they lose themselves and become commonplace. This applies equally to
Rüysdael and to Jacob Maris; doubtless it is an expression of the
national temperament of the Dutchman. Generally upon emerging from
a contemplation of the old men into a modern artistic environment a
feeling of repulsion creeps over one, but this is not the case here.
Rüysdael and Rembrandt seem strangely in harmony with Maris and Mauve,
and in this fact may be found a plea for the endurance of the latter.
A very different impression is given, for instance, when one leaves
an eighteenth-century French picture and comes to a modern French
landscape. The modern Dutch school have maintained the traditions of
their predecessors, and one of them at least—Jacob Maris—is worthy
to be put on the same plane as Rüysdael and Hobbema. ¶ In the small
gallery upstairs the student of seventeenth-century Dutch art will find
much to admire, still more to interest him, and not a few examples
which will tax his ingenuity as to attribution. Among these last are
some of the six pictures ascribed to Rembrandt. The most important,
and perhaps the one which should attract the most attention, is the
large landscape Le Commencement d’Orage, which is surpassed by little
in the landscape work of Rembrandt for poetical intensity and incisive
truth. This picture is by most modern critics denied to Rembrandt; as
the question is one which must be fully dealt with, its discussion may
conveniently be postponed to the end of this paper. ¶ When we leave
this and come to the portraits we find but one, the Portrait of the
Painter’s Son Titus, which has any serious pretensions to be considered
as coming from his brush. Against this, however, nothing can be urged
in point of quality. Of the Dutch master’s last and finest manner—it
is dated 1655—it has all the pathetic realism of his unsubdued genius.
It is interesting to compare this canvas, which is undoubtedly a
portrait of Titus, with that of the same boy in the Wallace collection.
As this is dated authentically 1655, the Hertford House picture should
be painted within the next year, or at the latest in 1657, whereas
it is approximately dated in the catalogue 1658–60. On the score of
quality there is little to choose, but perhaps the English picture is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
in a better state of preservation. The Head of a Man, a careful work,
and with many good qualities to recommend it, is in all probability a
work of Solomon de Koninck, who was one of those pupils of Rembrandt
who assimilated most of his technicalities. The extreme timidity of
many of those points in which the bolder qualities of Rembrandt would
be brought into play, such as the handling of the nose, mouth and hair,
go far to convince us of the correctness of this attribution. Coming to
The Portrait of the Artist, it appears quite incomprehensible that a
picture of such inferior artistic qualities should have been seriously
considered for so long a period as a work of the master. Coming from
the collections of M. de Calonne, the Marquis Gerini and Mr. Agar,
engraved by Seuter and Townley, quoted in Smith, it serves to show the
hazy idea of even the best connoisseurs in the early days of the last
century. Such a work would be difficult to affiliate upon any of the
best known of Rembrandt’s pupils. The weakness of the drawing and lack
of power and roundness are clearly the work of but a second-rate man
of the period. The signature, moreover, presents no claim to serious
consideration. In Ruth and Naomi is possibly to be found the work of a
very interesting painter of the school of Rembrandt—Karel Fabritius,
who is little known yet in this country. It is painted with remarkable
strength and solidity, and although not a great achievement, is worthy
of comparison with some of those pictures which are ascribed to the
greater light upon very slender foundation. The picture, however, is
in such bad condition and has suffered so much that no one can tell
what it may have been when fresh. ¶ More interesting upon the whole
than the representation of Rembrandt and his School is that of Frans
Hals. His so-called Admiral de Ruyter (which is not a portrait of
that admiral) for decision and fearless handling has not an equal in
the gallery. It is not Hals as we see him at Hertford House, careful
and conscientious, though successful, but the spontaneous, daring
master whom we find at Haarlem and in the Louvre, at Cassel and St.
Petersburg. It is the Hals that we not only admire but also love, the
wonder of the cultured art-loving public, and—may we add it?—the
despair of the modern portrait painter. Such brushwork has only been
equalled, we shall not say surpassed, by a few masters, of whom
Velasquez stands out prominently. When, however, we turn to Van Goyen
and his Wife and Child, we have another instance of more than doubtful
attribution. The landscape is probably by Van Goyen, for it has many
of his characteristics of tree draughtsmanship and sober colour. The
figures, however, betray nothing of Hals beyond his influence, and even
the latter is only just allowable. They are well and strongly painted
in parts; but Hals would never be guilty of such loose handling as is
observable in the child in the foreground or such weak drawing as the
foot of Van Goyen betrays. There is but little from which to deduce
an attribution with any degree of certainty. The present ascription
is part of that system which insists on fathering upon Hals all the
portraits in this manner and of this period, in much the same way as
in the past all portraits which betrayed any of the technicalities of
Rembrandt were attributed to that master.</p>

</div>

<p>Turning from this to a
Group of Three we have a splendid example by a master whose history is
enshrouded still in much mystery, but who was, if one can judge from
his art, a pupil of Hals—we are referring to Jan Miense Molenaer. It
was evidently painted in the earlier portion of his career and has much
in common with The Spinet-players in the Rycks Museum at Amsterdam. A
scene which Hals would have revelled in depicting, full of uproarious
good humour, the picture presents attractions quite apart from its
superb technical qualities and masterly composition. Curiously enough,
upon the same wall we have two examples,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
Jovial Companions and The Health of the Troop, by Molenaer’s wife,
Judith Leyster, a painter of the school of Haarlem of the period when
Hals was at the height of his fame. They are both catalogued as being
collaborations by Hals and Judith Leyster, but beyond the potent
influence of the former they have nothing to do with him. As pictures
they are interesting to the student, but not for any striking qualities
which they present. The brushwork is of a character which one expects
from a painter who from self-assurance endeavours to emulate a bold
and dashing manner without possessing the ability of the prototype,
with the inevitable result of a coarse disjointedness irritating to
the last degree. The colour scheme of each is unpleasing too, blues
and reds being foiled against one another with a rashness which is
born of over confidence. Of quite another character is the little
Portrait of a Gentleman by Thomas de Keyser. The strong and firm
modelling of the face has not a weakness apparent anywhere, whilst, as
is usual with this master, he has placed a restraint upon himself which
sustains him through the most arduous task without loss of dignity or
ease of presentment. This grasp of his material leaves him when he
attempts anything on a large scale: he loses concentration and becomes
straggling. The picture is, however, overcleaned. ¶ But to revert to
the school of Hals again, there are few more instructive pictures in
the exhibition than The Portrait of a Dutch Lady by Jan Verspronck,
who was in many respects his cleverest pupil. This is a remarkably
characteristic example, the authenticity of which is convincingly
attested by the presence of the signature with the date 1643. It must
have occurred to many students that the scarcity of Verspronck’s
pictures is accounted for by their being not infrequently converted
into examples of the better-known master. They lend themselves very
readily to this from the strong affinities of technique. The great
point of difference is to be found in the lack of brilliancy and
freedom, qualities eminently characteristic of Hals, both in his early
and late period. But the delicate silveriness and luminosity of Hals
find an echo in the finest portraits of Verspronck. I remember seeing
a portrait of a man some years ago in London which was ascribed with
all confidence to Hals, until a close examination revealed the traces
of an obliterated signature of Verspronck on the background. Further,
I have always held the opinion that the superb Portrait of a Lady at
Antwerp is by this master, and a contemplation of the present picture
strengthens this view. ¶ One other portrait is well worthy of mention,
although it may be observed that it hardly comes within the scope of
an exhibition of Dutch Art, but we should have been considerably the
losers without it—the Portrait of Ambrogio, Marchese di Spinola, by
Cornelis de Vos. It is a superb piece of direct portraiture, full of
dignity and precision, and the ruff and breastplate are handled with
remarkable accuracy and vigour. ¶ Of the genre paintings the most
attention will be attracted by The Cook Asleep, a picture ascribed
to that very rare master Jan Vermeer of Delft. There is little of
his characteristic technique displayed in the treatment of the
accessories—the fruit and the bottle. Still, the girl, particularly in
the head and bosom, and the handling of the table-cloth, point to the
work of the great Delft master, to say nothing of the signature, which
has every appearance of being authentic. Nevertheless, to extol it as
a masterpiece—it is set forth as such in the catalogue—by Vermeer,
is quite unjustifiable when one remembers the picture in Mrs. Joseph’s
possession, the two in the Six Collection at Amsterdam, or those in
the Rycks Museum, the Louvre, and at Dresden and Berlin. There are
weaknesses, as witness the flat painting of the arms, and the diffusion
of light is not grasped with his wonted skill. It lacks just that
which delights one most in the master’s work. It is unfortunate that
a better picture to represent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span> Vermeer’s contemporary Gabriel Metzu
could not be obtained than A Woman Dressing Fish. I cannot agree with
Smith in describing it as ‘this excellent little picture’; indeed I
have grave doubts as to its being a genuine picture at all. Neither
does a Portrait of a Lady worthily display the magic and refined art
of Terborch, for the painting is careful even to timidity. Better by
far is the Portrait of a Young Woman, which, in spite of an unequal
tussle with the restorer, still presents some of his most charming
qualities. Both the head and hands are in his best manner, and the
black dress with its semi-transparent frills is full of such delicate
painting as characterizes The Portrait of a Gentleman in the National
Gallery. ¶ A most interesting panel, A Lady at a Harpsichord, is
ascribed to Palamedes. Great confusion has existed with regard to his
works in the past, arising from the fact that several painters have
an almost identical technique and painted similar subjects. Foremost
among these are Willem Cornelisz Duyster, Pieter Codde, Dirk Hals,
and that controversial and mysterious master, Hendrik Pot. The fine
picture at Hampton Court, described in the Commonwealth Inventory as
‘A Souldier making a Strange Posture to a Dutch Lady, by Bott,’ which
has been in turn assigned to Pieter Codde, Poelenburgh, Palamedes,
Mytens, and Hendrik Pot, is now permanently and rightly ascribed to
the last, an attribution arrived at by careful comparison with other
works, and further confirmed by the presence of Pot’s initials on
the chimneypiece—all in addition to the suggestive entry in the
Commonwealth Inventory. Now the panel in the exhibition is almost
identical in treatment, and also with that of the Convivial Party in
the National Gallery, and I think that Pot is much more likely to be
its creator than Palamedes. ¶ The life work of Jan Steen, so badly
illustrated at present in our public galleries, is well summed up
by the humorous and most masterly Portrait of Himself. Seated on a
chair, he bawls without restraint a ditty, no doubt culled from his
own cabaret, accompanying himself with a mandoline, which he plays
with evidently greater gusto than expression. Steen was no idealistic
dreamer: he believed in earthly enjoyment, and from this fact arose
the tales of dissipation of which modern investigation has proved
the falsity. Still, he seems to have largely been in sympathy with
the views of Omar Khayyam, and making ‘the most of what we yet may
spend.’ ¶ The ascription to Adriaen Brouwer of An Interior with
Figures is perhaps another misnomer. There is none of his exquisite
transparency, the colouring is opaque and lacks the brilliancy of his
palette, and the draughtsmanship has not nearly his precision. Again,
the figures in the foreground, although having much in common with
Brouwer, betray the influence of David Teniers, an influence still
more marked in those talking through the window. Consequently there
is a strange mixture of Dutch and Flemish art, which points to a
master conversant with both. Two men suggest themselves as its author,
Hendrik Sorgh and Joost van Craesbeeck, and the weight of evidence
is in favour of the latter, largely because of the Flemish sentiment
which pervades the whole composition and the presence of mannerisms
which are peculiar to Brouwer, which leads one to give the preference
to Craesbeeck rather than to Sorgh. Some particularly fine examples of
the still-life painters of Holland are shown, Jan van Huysum and Jan
van Os especially; whilst one of the three canvases by Willem van Aelst
(No. 167) is quite a new revelation of his powers.</p>

<p>Coming to the
landscape men, in some respects a pleasurable surprise awaits us, and
in others something akin to disappointment. The latter was furnished by
the representation of Jacob van Rüysdael, by whom no less than three
examples are shown. Good as they all will be considered, not one shows
to the full the intensely poetical side of his genius, a side which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
exemplified by the magnificent View of Haarlem in the Mauritshuis at
the Hague or the View over an extensive flat wooded Country in our own
National Gallery, places him far ahead of any painter of the Dutch
school for the rendering of dreamy poetry of nature. He must yield
the palm to Hobbema in tree painting and to Cüyp in landscape full of
delicate shimmer and sunny glow, and if Philips de Koninck is his equal
in the presentment of immensity of distance, he is left far behind
by Rüysdael’s atmospheric achievements. One point may be conceded
to Hobbema, namely, that he is more equal: he never painted a bad
picture, whereas Rüysdael frequently did so; but when the two are seen
at their best, the latter surpasses him by reason of his superiority
in catching that essentiality of landscape—<i>stimmung</i>. For want
of these qualities A Forest Scene, fine as it is from a technical
standpoint, and in a perfect state of preservation, does not show the
better side of Rüysdael. The Seapiece is better, but fails by reason
of its obviously forced sky. Its redeeming feature is the masculine
painting of the sea and its finely-felt distance. Perhaps the best is
the so-called View on the Brill, which is impressive whilst remaining
unsatisfactory. It is particularly unfortunate that a picture of
Rüysdael in his best and most soulful mood could not be found, for
then he would more than hold his own against any of the <i>plein
air</i> men in the remaining galleries. By Hobbema there are two
superb panels, A Woody Landscape with a gentleman on a grey horse, and
A Landscape, between which, although painted at different periods of
his career, there is little to choose in point of quality. However,
the latter suffers from over cleaning, particularly in some of those
parts—notably the middle distance—where Hobbema shines most, and this
gives it a rawness quite foreign to the picture in its pristine state.
Still, they are both profound in their grasp of nature and magnificence
of achievement. Cüyp, too, is equally well represented by A Herdsman
and a Woman tending Cattle, with its suffusion of golden sunlight over
the placid river. A delicately soft and delicious haze, so essential
a feature on a summer afternoon in the vicinity of a river, envelops
the whole composition from the finely-grouped cattle and figures in
the immediate foreground to the distant tower, and the portrayal of
the relation of the exquisitely truthful sky to the landscape was
vouchsafed to no Dutchman to a greater degree than to Cüyp. This is
the only example here of the Dordrecht master, for few will consider
seriously the pretensions of the Head of a Cow to be from his hand.
It is signed (but it is to be questioned if it is a contemporary
signature) Berchem, and it is possible that it is by that master, but
there are other men equally likely. ¶ A capital little landscape with
cattle represents the art of Adriaen van de Velde at its best. It is
well that such a picture has been chosen, for it is in its original
condition, unlike all too many which have become dark in parts owing
to the employment of unstable pigments. Another noteworthy example is
that by Jan van der Heyden; whether or not one is allowed to altogether
admire such finish, one cannot but wonder at the minute and painstaking
rendering of detail and at the masterly way with which, in spite of
his <i>finesse</i>, he preserves the unity of his composition. ¶ When
we come to the Aart van der Neer, a Moonlight River Scene, we are
confronted with a clever picture, but one which almost presents doubts
as to its being really from the hand of the master. In the first place
it is painted with a much fuller brush and broader handling than is
usual with Van der Neer. The trees, instead of being delicately, even
minutely wrought, are treated in broad masses, and the buildings have
not his directness; and one’s doubts are strengthened by the figures.
Now Van der Neer was never loose—if anything, his failing is in the
opposite direction—but here we have men in the foreground who are
even clumsy, whilst the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span> work has a lack or transparence which
raises grave doubts whether it is a Dutch picture at all. Here and
there is just a trace of a copyist, although a man of no mean talent
and one who was copying to arrive at the spirit of the Dutchmen. We
have at least one man of the English school who, if this hypothesis
has foundation, is capable of this, and many little mannerisms are
very like him; but some good authorities regard the picture as an
early work of Van der Neer, much over-cleaned and repainted. ¶ The
two Jan van de Cappelles are of unsurpassable beauty. In the little
Seapiece, with its placid water, an awful stillness pervading the
whole scene before the approaching storm, the last glimpses of lurid
light which catch the distant town before a complete envelopment in
inky blackness of the scene is accomplished, and the depth of the
picture, are quite wonderful. But it is rather to Off Scheveningen we
look for a thoroughly characteristic Van de Cappelle. The wonderful
sky and the amount of atmosphere infused into the whole theme raises
it quite on a level with the River Scene of the Wynn Ellis bequest in
the National Gallery, an equal of which for pure aerial painting we
have yet to see in a European Gallery. The present example is one which
surpasses Willem van de Velde at his best in all the higher qualities
of art. Another curious picture is the Rising in a Dutch Town,
ascribed to Gerrit Berkheyde. ¶ We will now return to Le Commencement
d’Orage; and in this connexion it may be convenient to quote the
passage referring to this picture which occurred in the notice of the
Guildhall Exhibition published in <i>The Times</i>, since it expresses
a view now widely held. The passage is as follows:—‘Another picture,
of great beauty and greater importance, has for more than a century
borne Rembrandt’s name—ever since de Marcenay engraved it with that
attribution. Yet it is absolutely certain that Lady Wantage’s great
picture, The Beginning of the Storm (174), is not by Rembrandt at
all, but is the masterpiece of Philip de Koning, who has two or three
similar but smaller works in the National Gallery, and whose signed
pictures since the days when Dr. Waagen wrote, have become perfectly
well known. Such a picture places de Koning in the very first rank of
landscape painters, and it is unjust to deprive him of it. It would
take us too long to give reasons for the change of name, but there
can be no doubt whatever about it. The picture, of course, shows the
influence of the mighty teacher throughout, but it is in point of
fact a better, truer, less fantastic landscape than he himself ever
painted. It makes the Cassel and other landscapes seem what they really
are—dreams, not transcripts from nature in any sense of the term.’ ¶
That the opinion thus dogmatically expressed is that of the majority
of critics cannot be denied, but I venture still to acquiesce in the
attribution to Rembrandt and I will give my grounds for so doing. In
the first place the view is just of such a character as de Koninck
painted—an extensive landscape seen from a height with river and
distant sandhills, the intervening space studded here and there with
hamlets. When, however, we come to compare the technique here with that
in accepted pictures by de Koninck, such as the landscape No. 836 in
the National Gallery, the only similarity which can be traced to him is
in the handling of the bank of the river at the right and the bushes
above it. But this is much too powerfully realized for de Koninck, it
has a force and breadth which the pupil never put forward. This point
can be observed by comparison with the National Gallery picture, which
has a very similar foreground only much more restrainedly achieved.
Again, the qualities to be found in the roofs by the windmill on the
left of the picture and the trees over them are such as are found in
all Rembrandt’s work, whether he is working in oil or with the etching

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
de Koninck have such an impressive and powerful opposition of sunlight
and gloom as we have here. He may be wonderfully fascinating in
rendering the delicate silveriness of certain phases of atmospherical
freshness but he is never soul-stirring, which is a quality I claim
for Lady Wantage’s picture. In the sky painting there is much affinity
between this and the Peel picture as regards the cloud cumuli, but a
reference to the Landscape with Tobias and the Angel (No. 72) in the
National Gallery will disclose an identity which demonstrates that
the other similarity is only of such a character as would be found in
the work of a very clever pupil assimilating his master’s technique.</p>

<p>Before leaving this picture it would be useful to draw attention to
the parallel rendering of several details—the trees and the sunlight
hill in the background. Now in the second period of Rembrandt, which
is tentatively placed by students as lying between 1640 and 1649, much
attention to landscape is a prominent characteristic. Particularly was
this the case with regard to his work with the needle. This culminated
in the production of that most impressive of all his landscape
etchings, The Three Trees. If that etching is compared with the present
picture, many points of similarity will be observed, not only with
regard to the extensive view on the left of that etching, but with
regard to its realization and general feeling, beside which the art of
de Koninck appears but a triviality. The Three Trees is dated 1643,
and I am inclined to place this picture at about the same period, or
at any rate between 1640 and 1643. With this date the technique is in
strict consonance. Philips de Koninck we know was born in 1619, so
that at this period he would be twenty-one, a very impressionable age,
and I would hazard the suggestion, although the evidence is purely
presumptive, that not only was this landscape the forerunner of The
Three Trees, but that its production at the period when de Koninck was
probably a pupil of Rembrandt, or at any rate had but just emerged from
his studio, influenced the former to such an extent that it actually
inspired his future landscapes, the similar character of which is so
well known. Hence the importance of Le Commencement d’Orage for us. ¶
Yet another plea may be urged for the acceptance of the work as being
by Rembrandt. It is an accepted fact, that the etchings of Hercules
Seghers had great influence on Rembrandt. The inventory of his effects
made in 1656 shows that he had in his possession six landscapes by
Seghers in addition to the copper of Tobias and the Angel, which
latter he reworked and it appears in Rembrandt’s work as the Flight
into Egypt. Seghers, as is well known, was a lover of these vast Dutch
plains seen from a height, as witness his flat Dutch landscape seen
from a height with water in the foreground, and a flat Dutch landscape
with a winding river. Now Seghers was born about 1590 and died
somewhere about 1640, and it is fair to presume that at this latter
date Rembrandt came into possession of the plate of Tobias and the
Angel. This is the very period to which I attribute the production of
Le Commencement d’Orage, and it is a noteworthy fact that prior to this
date we have nothing akin to this and subsequent landscapes, so that it
is fair to presume that the art of Seghers created the landscape art of
Rembrandt as exemplified by The Three Trees and subsequent etchings,
and through him the art of Philips de Koninck. ¶ Moreover the picture
of Tobias and the Angel in the National Gallery is directly executed
under the influence of Seghers, and I have already drawn attention to
the similarity between the building of the sky in this picture and that
of Lady Wantage’s. In view of these considerations it would seem that
the champions of Philips de Koninck must show more adequate reasons
before robbing Rembrandt of the authorship of this superb landscape.</p>

beginning a series of articles on Staffordshire wares, which are
intended to sketch the history of those fascinating old pieces now so
eagerly sought by the collector of pottery, our first duty is to select
a convenient starting point. It is improbable that in a county so
rich in materials as Staffordshire the making of pottery has suffered
any serious intermission since prehistoric times; but I think we may
safely assume that the collector, as distinct from the antiquary,
will feel little interest in any of the productions of this district
prior to the seventeenth century. If we except Gothic paving tiles, a
few of the better costrels or pilgrim’s bottles, and the mysterious
‘poteries gracieuses de la reine Elizabeth’ (which, whatever they are,
no one thinks of claiming for Staffordshire), it may be said that
for five centuries after the Norman conquest the ceramic art of this
country boasted nothing better than coarse pitchers, gotches, gourds,
and gorges of clumsy shape and uncouth ornament, which appeal to few
but the sternest antiquarians. With the seventeenth century, however,
begins a new period of development, very gradual at first, but full
of interest. ¶ To anyone who has recently visited the Potteries, and
seen the great conglomerate of towns intersected by railways and
tramlines, with its forest of chimneys and the constantly burning
kilns of numberless factories that supply the markets of the world,
it is difficult to picture the same district 300 years ago, wooded,
wild and picturesque. The great towns were then represented by a few
moorland hamlets, the teeming factories by occasional ‘hovels’ and
‘sun-kilns,’ and the armies of workmen by the solitary potter, who,
helped by one or two labourers or by his own household alone, threw,
glazed and fired his weekly ovenload of crocks, which his wife took to
town on a donkey to exchange for the necessaries of life. It is not a
very promising picture from a collector’s point of view; and yet in the
first few years of the seventeenth century and in circumstances little
less primitive than those we have just described, a number of pieces
were made that are now eagerly sought after by persons of taste. I need
hardly say that it is not the common crocks made for the market or fair
that have achieved this apotheosis. The vessels with
which we are at present concerned were, we may be sure, of the
kind ‘made for honour,’ <i>tours de force</i> to celebrate special
occasions, and to be cherished among the heirlooms of the poor.

<p>For the right understanding of our subject, it will be necessary to go into
a few technical details gathered from the earliest notice (in Dr. Plot’s
‘Natural History of Staffordshire,’ 1689) of the industry, and from the
silent evidence of the pots themselves. At Burslem, which even in Plot’s
time was the ‘greatest pottery’ of the district, only four kinds of
clay were in use for the body of the wares: bottle clay, hard fireclay
which was mixed with red blending clay to make black wares, and a
white clay, so called because it produced a yellow ware, which was the
nearest approach to white then obtainable. Besides these there were
three finer clays reserved for decorative purposes, known as orange
slip, white slip, and a red slip which burnt black. Slip, it must be
explained, was a creamy fluid made of clay softened by water. The glaze
was produced by powdered lead ore dusted on to the ware. For special
pieces the ore was first calcined. Used in its simple form, this
powder, when fired, covered the ware with a transparent glass of a warm
yellow tone, which gave a rich reddish brown surface to a red body, a
yellow colour to white slip ornament, and a similar augmentation to
clays of other tints. Only two colouring oxides appear to have been
used—manganese, from which a colour was obtained varying according
to its intensity from purplish brown to black, and commonly used to
streak or mottle the glaze, and oxide of copper, which produced a
bright green effect. The unsophisticated potter called the lead ore
<i>smithum</i> and the manganese <i>magnus</i>. A little Latin went
a long way in the district. ¶ Such were the simple materials that the
seventeenth-century potter had at his disposal, differing scarcely at
all from those used by his mediaeval forerunners. Let us see what use
he made of them, when working at his best. <a href="#i_064d">Fig. I</a> shows an ornamental
dish for a cottage dresser. <a href="#i_065a">Fig. II</a> is a type of drinking cup used on
special occasions. Other not inelegant drinking vessels of the period
are beaker-shaped, or in the form of an elongated dice-box with two
handles close together; these are always in black ware. Another shape
is seen in <a href="#i_065b">Fig. III</a>. The principal feature of most of these quaint
tygs, or loving-cups, is their astonishing number of handles, which
range from two to as many as twelve. It is supposed that the purpose of
this equipment was that the cup might pass from hand to hand, and each
guest have a fresh portion of the rim to himself, no doubt an excellent
arrangement for the first
time round! Not content with half a dozen or so of full-grown
handles, the potter frequently inserted between each of them a
sort of rudimentary handle consisting of a looped strip of clay.
Another variety of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span> tyg was called a posset pot, and was usually
distinguished by a spout. The posset pot would seem to have been a
family possession preserved with great respect, and used only on
special occasions, such as Christmas time. It also suffered from
a plethora of handles. Of any exact recipe for a posset I must
plead ignorance, but I fancy it as a compound of mulled ale with
an indefinite something floating on the surface, succulent, and
exceedingly popular. There were other and still more fanciful drinking
vessels besides these. A fuddling cup is shown in <a href="#i_065f">Fig. VIII</a>. When it
is realized that the six cups communicate with each other internally,
so that to empty one you must empty all, the force of the name will
be apparent. Any doubt as to the use of these formidable vessels is
dispelled by the inscription on a similar piece, <i>Fill me ful of
sidar, drink of me</i>. The puzzle jug is another playful variety.
<a href="#i_066b">Fig. IX</a> is an elaborate example from which it will be seen that the liquor
must be extracted in some unusual way if the drinker wants to get his
full measure, and has any respect for his clothes. The rim and handle
are tubes, communicating with the body of the jug, through which the
contents must be sucked from a spout in front of the rim,
in this case the bird’s beak. To complicate matters there are usually
one or more concealed holes in the tubes which must be stopped by the
fingers, in addition to a false spout or two, such as is seen on the
side of the rim. The puzzle jug is a joke of long standing. Specimens
have been found which go back to the fourteenth century, and the trick
is not quite unknown at the present day. No doubt their existence was
prolonged by the far-seeing publican who appreciated the possibilities implied in
the following doggerel that appears on one of them:—</p>

<p>Another pleasant surprise was furnished by the toad mug, in which
the drinker as he neared the bottom discovered a well-modelled toad,
usually of red clay with white slip eyes. <a href="#i_067a2">Fig. XI</a> is an example of a
rarer class. The owl jug was made with a removable head which could
be used as a cup. It is, however, a disputed question whether these
jugs are of Staffordshire origin, and it is hinted that they have a
suspiciously close parallel in German pottery. Other special forms of
a less bibulous kind are shown in <a href="#i_066a">Fig. VII</a>, a model of a cradle which
tells its own tale; and <a href="#i_067a1">Fig. X</a>, a horn lantern. Candlesticks, handovens
and condiment trays also occur. ¶ We must now return for a moment to
technicalities in order to understand the remaining feature of our
wares, their ornament. The tyg, jug, cradle or piece of whatever form,
was sometimes left to depend for its popularity on its streaky purplish
brown or glossy black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span> glaze alone, neither of them a recommendation
to be despised; or it was embellished with a scratched design, a
pattern impressed by wooden stamps, or applied pads of clay moulded
or stamped with rosettes, formal ornament, and occasionally with the
human form. I have seen a tyg with busts of King Charles I disposed
round its perimeter, an unusually ambitious design for a potter of
the period. The handles were made a still more conspicuous feature by
the addition of twists of coloured clay, knobs and bosses. ¶ Another
and a larger group were ornamented with the slips we spoke of above.
These were applied in various ways. First as simple washes to give a
light surface to a dark body or <i>vice versa</i> (see Figs. <a href="#i_066b">IX</a> and
<a href="#i_067b">XII</a>). Or again they were dropped or trailed on from a spouted vessel
in quaint tracery, dotted patterns, or outlined designs. As might be
expected at this period, the tulip more or less conventionalized was a
favourite motive. The process is best understood by taking an example.
<a href="#i_067b">Fig. VII</a> is of light buff ware: the ornament on the upper part, and
the inscription and date, WILLIAM CHATERLY, 1696, were traced in black
slip dotted with white; the lower half was immersed in black slip, and
the pattern added in white; the whole was then leaded and fired. ¶ A
third method consisted in dropping slip of one or more colours on the
surface and working it about with a wire brush or leather comb until an
effect similar to our graining or paper marbling was obtained. Wares
so treated are called combed or marbled wares (see Figs. <a href="#i_067a2">XI</a> and <a href="#i_068">XIII</a>).
This process, seen on the tall bottle-shaped costrels attributed to
the sixteenth century, continued in its primitive form to the middle
of the eighteenth century, when it developed into the agate ware of
Whieldon and Wedgwood and their contemporaries. ¶ Lastly, there was
<i>graffiato</i> ware, in which a thick coating of slip was laid over a
body of contrasting colour and the pattern scratched through so as to
discover the body beneath (see <a href="#i_065f">Fig. VIII</a>). This kind of ornament has
been in use in all countries and from the earliest times. It is seen
at its best on Italian pottery from the quattrocento onwards, and the
continuance of its Italian name is a compliment to the masterpieces of
that country.</p>

</div>

<p>It remains to speak of dates and localities. Those of
our wares that have no slip decoration can be traced back to the first
years of the seventeenth century, if not to Elizabethan times. They
continued to the early part of the eighteenth century, when they either
disappeared or were improved out of recognition. Like all primitive
wares, they were manufactured all over the country, and though it is
certain that a large number of them were made in Staffordshire,
it would be difficult to claim any particular piece for that district.
Slip decoration, which dates back to mediaeval times, was equally
universal. Indeed we know that a well-defined class of slip ware with
stamped ornaments and patterns of dots and dashes was made at Wrotham
in Kent from 1612–1717. Another group with a distinctive kind of scroll
and fern ornament in thin white slip, and inscriptions usually of
Puritanical tone, was made in or near London from the middle of the
sixteenth century. A third kind is attributed with much probability
to Cockpit Hill, Derby. It is characterized by moulded patterns
with raised outlines which contained the coloured slips much as the
<i>cloisons</i> contain the enamels on <i>cloisonnée</i> work. ¶ But
the best slipware of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span> Staffordshire, as exemplified by
Figs. <a href="#i_064d">I</a>, <a href="#i_067b">XII</a>,
and <a href="#i_069a">XIV</a>, is unmistakable in style, and yields to none in picturesque
effect. Our earliest clue to its history was given by the simple legend
scratched on the back of a dish similar
to <a href="#i_064d">Fig. I</a>, THOMAS TOFT. TINKERS CLOUGH. I MADE IT., 166–. Tinker’s
Clough is a lane between Shelton and Wedgwood’s Etruria. On the
strength of this modest confession the name Toft ware has been applied
by many writers to all slipwares of this class, and even to slipware
generally. A number of other names, sometimes with dates, are found on
these wares (<i>e.g.</i> Ralph Toft 1676, Charles Toft, Ralph Turnor
1681, Robart (<i>sic</i>) Shaw 1692), many of them no doubt the names
of potters, others of those for whom the pots were made. Slipware,
though naturally superseded by the finer earthenwares of the eighteenth
century, is not yet extinct, and may be seen occasionally at country
fairs of the present day. ¶ The question of Staffordshire delft ware is
too long to consider here. It is a moot point if any such thing existed
before the eighteenth century, and it is certain that delft was never
made there to any extent worth considering. But this article would be
incomplete if one omitted to give a few of the quaint inscriptions that
are a feature of the various kinds of pots we have discussed. They
tell their own story and need no comment:—</p>

<p>Robert Pool mad this cup With gud posset fil and</p>
</div>

<p>The aposiopesis in the last is pregnant with meaning. ¶ Naturally
after all these years good examples of old Staffordshire wares are
scarce, and when they appear in the market they can only be bought at
proportionately good prices, owing to the eagerness with which they
are sought by the collector. And <i>me judice</i> they deserve all the
attention they get. There is something genuinely fascinating in their
naïve simplicity and their entire lack of all that is artificial or
extraneous. We do not, of course, pretend that for instance the use
of slip originated in this country, but the particular application of
it that is so characteristic of the Staffordshire wares is of purely
native development. These early pots are like the potters who made them
and their friends who used them, English to the backbone.</p>

national collection of silversmiths’ work at South Kensington
has lately been enriched by the acquisition of a silver chalice of
exceptional beauty and interest, which has reached this country, by
way of Denmark, with the history of having belonged formerly to the
church of Grundt, a village in the north of Iceland. ¶ As will be seen
from the illustration, the chalice is of the early type in which the
round contour prevails, in hemispherical bowl, bulb-shaped knop, and
circular foot. The bowl is of fine workmanship, fashioned with the
hammer with admirable uniformity, and finished with a high polish on
the outside. Round its margin runs the leonine hexameter (with some
allowances) + SVMMITVR HINC NVNDA DIVINI SANGVINIS VNDA (no doubt for
‘sumitur hinc munda divini sanguinis unda ’).<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The lettering of the
inscription, of which a rubbing is shown, is interesting, apart from
the beauty and freedom of its forms, in helping to fix an approximate
date for the object it adorns. ¶ The knop, separated from the bowl by
a narrow indented necking with beaded edges, is cast hollow, pierced
and chiselled with four compartments of foliage. The leafage in each
compartment is of a different design, and in each springs from the
turned-up ends of a circumscribing band stamped with a row of annulets
(see <a href="#i_071">illustration</a>). The upper spandrels so formed are filled each
with a small leaf; the lower are blank. ¶ The trumpet-shaped foot is
finished round the margin with a bevel, engraved with a rudimentary
fret and turned out at the edge in a narrow rim. At its junction with
the knop it is enriched with a border of vertical leaves rising from a
kind of nebuly band. The workmanship of the foot is notably inferior
to that of the bowl; the hammermarks are plainly visible inside, and
outside no careful polishing has smoothed away the concentric markings
of the turning tool which was used, after the hammer, on both bowl and
foot. It may perhaps be suggested that the inferior finish of the foot
is evidence of its not having originally belonged to the bowl; but the
suggestion is discredited by the excellent proportion existing between
the two, and by the similarity of both to the corresponding parts of
other examples about to be noticed. It is more probable that a higher
finish was imparted to the bowl in deference to its function as the
receptacle of the consecrated wine. ¶ To conclude the description, the
enriched portions, that is to say, the band of inscription round the
bowl, the knop with the parts adjacent, and the bevel of the foot,
and these only, are gilt, by the old mercury process, with a pale
gold. The measurements are: height 4<span class="fract"><span class="numer">13</span>⁄<span class="denom">16</span></span> in. (12˙2 cm.), diameter of
bowl 3¾ in. (9˙5 cm.), diameter of foot 3<span class="fract"><span class="numer">9</span>⁄<span class="denom">16</span></span> in. (9 cm.). With the
chalice is a paten of plain silver, a slightly concave disc 5<span class="fract"><span class="numer">1</span>⁄<span class="denom">16</span></span> in.
(12˙9 cm.) in diameter, with a roughly-formed circular depression. As
this is of very rough make, and has no appearance of being that which
originally accompanied the chalice, it need not be referred to further.</p>

<p>The shape of the chalice is sufficient, by comparison with other
examples, to determine its date approximately. It may be compared, in
respect of its hemispherical bowl, its flattened globular knop, and its
trumpet-shaped foot with bevelled margin, with a much larger and more
ornate example in the church of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
the Holy Apostles at Cologne, shown by the character of its ornament
to be of the early part of the thirteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> While in the
latter example, however, the bowl and knop are separated by a stem
equal in length to at least half of the height of the knop, in our
chalice they are separated only by the narrow indented band with beaded
edges already noticed.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> ¶ A closer parallel, though again on a
larger scale, is furnished by an example dated 1222, formerly in the
Heckscher collection, and now in the possession of Sir Samuel Montagu,
where all the main features referred to are reproduced, and a much
closer similarity in the spacing of bowl and knop is observable.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
¶ Still more to the point, however, is a silver chalice found at
Sorö, in Denmark, in the year 1827, with an episcopal ring, in the
grave of Absalon, bishop of Lund (died 1201).<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> We have here an
example from the latter part of the twelfth or the first year of the
thirteenth century, reproducing almost exactly the outlines of our
chalice already described, and in almost the same dimensions. In the
bishop’s chalice the knop is plain, and set off by a band of shallow
fluting above and below; but these differences of detail, and even a
somewhat wider separation of bowl and knop, cannot veil the striking
resemblance of type between the two. ¶ The inscription with its
combination of uncial and capital letters furnishes further evidence
of date. In general style, as well as in its peculiarities of the
use of both varieties of D, the freely curved G, and the A with bent
cross-stroke, it shows considerable affinity to the inscription on the
ivory cross of Gunhilda (died 1076), grand-niece of Canute, in the
Copenhagen Museum.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The same peculiarities, as well as the V with a
circle on its sinister stroke, are to be observed in the inscriptions
on the altar frontal of Lisbjerg, in Denmark, assigned to the twelfth
century. The tendency towards curved forms, however, shown in the
rounding of the interior of the capital D’s and in the curving-in of
the tails of these letters and of the R may be more closely matched, in
default of a Scandinavian example, in the inscriptions on the bronze
font at Hildesheim, assigned to the second quarter of the thirteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> At this date, however, the fully-developed Lombardic
character has so far prevailed over the roman capital that it is only
by picking out letters here and there, existing as survivals among
their curved supplanters, that such pure capital or transitional
characters as form the staple of our inscription can be matched. ¶ The
foliage on the knop is in two of the groups of that conventional type
which, apparently in reality a debasement of the classical acanthus,
is employed in the decoration of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
as the leafage of the symbolical vine; and the bud-shaped objects
springing among the leaves in one compartment are clearly intended
for such bunches of grapes as are similarly rendered in ironwork of
the thirteenth century. Foliage of similar character, rising in the
same way from the curved ends of the circumscribing band, may be
observed on certain of the carved church doors of the twelfth century
in Norway,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> where such groups, employed in rows side by side,
distinctly recall an enrichment of classical architecture. It is less
easy to speak confidently of another of the bunches of leaves, which
suggests the growth either of a trumpet-shaped lichen or possibly of
an arum lily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span> The single flat leaf with curled edges seems clearly
the leaf of a water-plant. Perhaps it is not too fanciful to see in
this and the vine foliage already noticed a reference to the two
constituents of the sacramental element. ¶ Turning to the question of
nationality, it is to be remarked that the inscription and the lines
enclosing it, one above and two below, are entirely engraved in that
zigzag line, reminding one of the mark of an assayer’s tool, which
is an almost constant characteristic, even till recent times, of
Scandinavian silversmiths’ work; and the fret round the foot shows the
same peculiarity. It has already been said that the chalice comes to us
with a tale of a distant but active centre of Scandinavian art. If it
be doubted whether such highly developed work could have been produced
in Iceland at the date indicated it may be recalled that this remote
island, whose inhabitants anticipated by five centuries the discovery
of Columbus, was at this time the home of a culture such as could
hardly be boasted by continental Scandinavia—a land, indeed, ‘where,
long before the “literary eras” of England or Germany, a brilliant
period of intellectual life produced and elaborated in its own distinct
form of expression a literature superior to any north of the Alps.’<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
¶ Gathering the conclusions to which all indications point, there
seems every reason to regard this beautiful little chalice as an
example of Scandinavian work, of a date not later than the early part
of the thirteenth century, produced, it may well be, in that farthest
outpost of European culture whence already in the dark ages a hand was
stretched out from the old world to the new.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of the Italian manuscripts is a Book of
Hours—<i>Officium Beatae Virginis Marine secundum consuetudinem
Romanae Curiae</i>—belonging to the early part of the sixteenth
century, and evidently made for a member of the famous Bentivoglio
family: perhaps Giovanni, born in 1505. The Bentivoglio arms appear
on the first page; on folio 41 in two cartouches within the border
are the words IOANNES, BEN; and on folio 109, in one cartouche
similarly placed, IO·BEN. The writing of this volume is very good;
the more important initials are well drawn, and pleasantly placed
in architectural compartments decorated above and below with the
characteristic ornament of the period. Indeed one would say that the
composition and arrangement of the less ornate pages of the book are
its best features. There are twenty-two full-page illuminations,
each containing an elaborate initial, within a rich border of
brightly-coloured arabesque ornament, generally in compartments. The
decoration is well drawn and distributed, though the drawing of the
figures in the initials, and of the half-human grotesques in the
borders, leaves something to be desired. An interesting and useful
feature—though one by no means uncommon—is the use of jewellery to
give relief to the arabesques. ¶ From the calligraphic point of view
only, a tall folio of the four Gospels, with commentary (Italian,
twelfth century), is possibly the most important of the gift, and
should be especially useful to students. The text is written in a large
minuscule character, beautifully spaced and proportioned, occupying
the centre of each page. In either margin occur the notes in much
smaller writing. Practically the whole decoration consists of initials
in blue and red, with here and there a rare display of bold but
simple pen-drawn ornament and a few chapter headings of tall, cramped
lettering, of which the initial has never been supplied. A ‘Thesaurus’
of St. Cyril of Alexandria is another valuable example of fine Italian
writing; in this instance, of the end of the fifteenth century in date.
A border and a few fine initials in gold, blue, pale red and green of
cunningly contrived interlacements—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span> the case of the border further
embellished with <i>amorini</i>, birds, etc.—are the only decorations
of note. This volume also includes a work by St. John Chrysostom, and
formerly belonged to the Minutoli Tegrimi family of Lucca, whose stamp
defaces some of the pages. A small Book of Hours is to be referred
to the same period and locality as the latter; it has, however, much
more elaborate decoration; the superposition of numerous beasts,
birds, and insects on the interlacing scroll-work of the borders, is,
though interesting, by no means an improvement. These animals are, it
must be admitted, rendered with curious care; while the two full-page
miniatures adorning the volume, as it stands, are of quite a high order
of merit. They represent The Annunciation and David killing Goliath—a
particularly spirited drawing, with a beautiful little miniature
of the Man of Sorrows in a cartouche on the page facing it; four
storied initials within borders also serve to mark the commencements
of various offices. The capitals, in gold, on these pages are very
finely written. The kalendar is complete, and contains references to
several local saints, indicating Umbria as the district for use in
which it was made. ¶ A Missal belonging in date to the beginning of
the fifteenth century, is a good example of Italian writing adorned
with fine pen-drawn scrolls and storied initials treated in a broad,
simple style of colouring and foliage. The pen-work, interesting for
its restraint and formality, differs greatly in this respect from
that of the more northern schools. There are sixteen large storiated
initials, of which attention may be drawn to those on folios 283, a
Monstrance displayed on an altar; 292, the Celebration of Mass; and a
representation of the absolutions at the side of a dead man, clothed
and hooded in red and lying on a couch; the prayer is read by a monk
in a white habit, attended by another similarly dressed who supports
a tall cross which has lighted candles on either arm. The kalendar is
very full, and has been corrected in a later handwriting in several
places. Immediately following it, in two pages of small script, is
the <i>Ordo ad faciendum aquā bn̄dictam</i>. ¶ A small Italian Book
of Hours is archaeologically interesting because it is signed in a
colophon on folio 266. ‘Frater paulus de mediolano ordīs scī B’tholomei
de hermineis sc’psit’ (late fifteenth century). The name of this writer
is believed to be unrecorded hitherto; the script is thoroughly Italian
in character, but the decoration has decided Netherlandish tendencies.
Several northern saints are inserted in the kalendar—by another
hand—including St. Brandan. ¶ In conclusion mention may be made of a
small Book of Devotions with borders and miniatures of considerable
merit and interest, placed within architectural frames. On the first
page is a coat of arms, which however has evidently been superimposed
on an earlier design. The writing is good and the initials well placed
and coloured. At the end on a tablet are the initials S.H., but these
have not been identified. The work is French, probably southern, and
in date belongs to the first half of the sixteenth century. ¶ The
works mentioned in these notes are only a few of the large collection
given by Mr. Reid. They are all now exhibited near the entrance to the
National Art Library.</p>

<p>The most interesting among recent additions to the Print Room are
woodcuts, both old and new. A chiaroscuro by Andreani, after Alessandro
Casolani of Siena, representing the Pietà, or Lamentation for Christ,
is remarkable both for its great size—it measures nearly six feet
by four—and for its rarity. Other impressions exist at Bassano and
Berlin. The figures, St. John supporting the dead Saviour, and a
second group of three holy women in attendance on the Virgin, are
nearly of the size of life, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span> wood-engraver evidently set
himself the task of producing the closest possible facsimile of a
large cartoon, outlined in charcoal and washed with neutral tints. He
has succeeded very well, and he was fortunate, considering the date,
1592, in obtaining so fine a composition on which to exert his skill.
The design has been cut throughout on three sets of blocks, one for
the black outline and two for tone. The impression, on many sheets of
paper joined together, is in good preservation, but the lowest portion
has perhaps been cut away, for there is no trace of the inscription,
recorded by Kolloff in his catalogue of Andreani’s works (No. 15),
that contains the dedication of the print to Vincenzo Gonzaga, duke
of Mantua, with the names of the artists and the date and place of
publication. Andreani had worked hitherto at Rome, Florence, and Siena.
It was to this dedication, apparently, and to his success in such an
important print, that he owed a summons to Mantua, his native city,
and a commission from the duke to reproduce in chiaroscuro Mantegna’s
Triumph of Caesar. ¶ Another woodcut of smaller but still considerable
dimensions (39¾ by 28¼ inches) bears the address ‘Gedruckt zu Nürmberg
Bey hans Wolff Glaser,’ cut upon the block in a tablet at the left
lower corner. Glaser was a ‘Briefmaler’ or petty publisher, printer,
and wood-engraver, who was at work at Nuremberg in the middle, or
third quarter, of the sixteenth century. His name is most familiar as
the publisher of one of the late editions of the portrait of Dürer at
the end of his life. The present work represents the Trinity, with
angels in adoration. These angels are copied, for the most part, from
Dürer’ fine woodcut of 1511 (B. 122), but they have been sadly spoilt
in the process of enlargement. Glaser’s work is coarse throughout, and
remarkable only for the rarity which it shares with most early woodcuts
of exceptional size. ¶ A fine impression of the portrait of Luther as
an Augustinian friar, after Cranach, dated 1520 (P. 194), has been
well coloured by a contemporary hand. A tablet at the bottom contains
the undescribed Latin inscription, EFFIGIES DOCTORIS MARTINI LVTHERI
| AVGVSTINIANI WITTENBERGĒSIS | 1520. The Holy Dove is added at the
top on a separate block, which also completes the arch. The portrait,
rare in the early, original impressions, hardly deserves to rank with
the woodcuts drawn by Cranach himself on the block; it seems, rather,
to be a good adaptation of an engraving on copper of the same year (P.
8, Sch. 7), in which Luther stands in front of a niche. Dr. Flechsig
finds much fault with the engraving itself, and will not allow it to
be more than a copy of the other engraved portrait of Luther (B. 5,
Sch. 6), with a plain background. With this woodcut were purchased
three interesting and undescribed etchings of knights arrayed for the
tournament, by the monogrammist C. S., a German artist of about 1550.
¶ A dainty little book, without text, but with the address, A LION |
PAR IAN DE TOVRNES. | M.D. LVI, within a graceful arabesque border, on
the first page, contains proofs of sixty blocks by wood-engravers of
the Lyons school, printed throughout on the recto of the leaf. ‘Das
gebet Salomonis’ (S. Grimm, Augsburg, 1523; 8vo.) has a pretty border
to the title, and a woodcut, Moses receiving the Tables of the Law,
both by the fascinating illustrator known provisionally as ‘The Master
of the Trostspiegel.’ A more important illustrated book is ‘Die Legend
des heyligen vatters Francisci,’ printed by Hölzel at Nuremberg in
1512, and profusely illustrated with woodcuts by Wolf Traut. The fine
copy recently purchased for the Print Room was formerly in the library
of William Morris. ¶ Another volume, still more intimately associated
with the author of ‘The Earthly Paradise,’ is the gift of Mr. George
Young Wardle, a friend and associate of Morris. It contains a complete
set, one of a very small number in existence, of proofs rubbed by
hand from unpublished blocks, designed by Burne-Jones, to illustrate
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span> tale of ‘Cupid and Psyche.’ The illustrations, forty-four in
number, were drawn upon the block by Mr. Wardle himself from the rough
sketches of Burne-Jones, which are now at Oxford. Morris, in revolt
against the methods of professional wood-engravers, had a few blocks
cut by amateurs, chosen among his own friends, and then took up the
task himself and cut by far the larger number with his own hands. To
these illustrations are added some initials and decorative borders,
both designed and cut by Morris. The story of the projected edition has
been told in ‘A Note on the Kelmscott Press.’ The scheme was abandoned
about 1870. The woodcuts, accordingly, belong to the period of English
illustrations generally described as ‘the sixties,’ and are separated
by a long interval from the later Burne-Jones woodcuts, including the
Chaucer series, which were printed in the ‘nineties,’ at the Kelmscott
Press. They are as full of romance as anything that Burne-Jones ever
drew, and the cutting, inexperienced and occasionally faulty as it
is, often preserves the freshness of the original sketch as no mere
hack engraver’s work would have done. It must not be forgotten,
however, that the defects of the cutting, in the opinion of Morris and
Burne-Jones themselves, were so serious as to make the publication of
the blocks undesirable. In addition to such rubbed proofs as those
lately in Mr. Wardle’s possession, a small number of proofs exist which
were pulled at a later date in the printing-press, and do more justice
to the blocks.</p>

Leuchtenberg Gallery at St. Petersburg has lately yielded up some
of those treasures which it has long and jealously guarded. In 1852
Passavant published a <i>catalogue raisonné</i> of the pictures, with
illustrations in outline, and to many this large volume has been
the sole medium of introduction to the collection. Several of the
originals have now found their way to London, among them two which
bear the great name of Giorgione—an Adoration of the Shepherds, and a
Madonna and Child. Both appear in outline in Passavant’s book, under
the name of Barbarelli, the supposed cognomen of Giorgione, to which,
however, as modern research has shown, he is not entitled.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> ¶ The
Madonna and Child picture has now passed into the rich collection of
Mr. George Salting, of which assuredly it will not be one of the least
ornaments; here moreover it will hang in company with another picture
from the same hand, each admirably illustrating two different phases
of Cariani’s art. For to Cariani, the Bergamesque painter, must be
ascribed the authorship of this Madonna and Child, which reveals him
in a mood no less characteristic than does the fine Portrait of one of
the Albani Family, which Mr. Salting has generously placed on loan at
the National Gallery. It would be a fitting complement to see the new
Cariani hung near the other, if only to prove how charming an artist
he can be at times, and how far superior these examples are to the two
which the nation actually possesses at Trafalgar Square. ¶ Like all
artists not absolutely in the first rank, Cariani varies considerably
in quality of workmanship; indeed, owing to the peculiar local
characteristics of Bergamesque art Cariani is exceptionally protean
in form, appearing now in Venetian guise, now in Brescian, now in his
own native awkwardness. For by nature he was not gifted with great
refinement, or with a strong individuality, and when the temporary
influence of Lotto, or of Palma Vecchio, or even of Previtali, was
withdrawn, he easily lapsed into a slovenliness which repels, or into a
tastelessness which betrays his provincial origin. Fortunately this is
not the mood we feel in Mr. Salting’s Madonna. There is a homely strain
indeed, which makes the subject simply Mother and Child; a conception
which we find exactly paralleled in another charming work of his known
as La Vergine Cucitrice, or The Sempstress Madonna, in the Corsini
Gallery in Rome (see <a href="#i_081">illustration</a>). But the homeliness of conception
is in each case relieved by the exquisite setting; the landscape
background and especially the decorative foliage being treated with a
rare feeling for beautiful effects. Girolamo dai Libri’s lemon trees
and the leafy arbours of Lotto and Previtali do not make more charming
bowers than do Cariani’s rose hedge and his hanging limes. Add,
moreover, a certain fullness of form, a softness of expression, and a
harmony of colour, which can be traced to the direct influence of Palma
Vecchio in Venice, and you have in Mr. Salting’s picture probably the
most attractive Madonna and Child which Cariani ever painted. Can there
be better evidence of appreciation on the part of some bygone owner
than that he considered it worthy of the great Giorgione himself, and
that up to now it has borne this courtesy title?</p>

<p>The second ‘Giorgione’ which comes from the Leuchtenberg Gallery is
an Adoration of the Shepherds, now in the possession of Mr. Asher
Wertheimer, by whose kind permission it is reproduced here. No
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
excuse need be offered for its publication in <span class="smcap">The Burlington
Magazine</span>, inasmuch as it bears directly on one of the lesser
problems in our National Gallery, where, in the Venetian Room, has
hung for some years a similar painting ascribed to Savoldo. That this
ascription is erroneous is admitted in the large illustrated edition of
the catalogue, published a year or two ago by Sir Edward Poynter, the
director, and it seems a pity to keep the old label with Savoldo’s name
still attached to the frame. The National Gallery is a place of public
resort, and the public believes in the labels it reads; for what does
the public know of Savoldo? Those, however, who have studied his work
at Venice, Milan, Verona, and elsewhere know that our National Gallery
picture is only in a remote degree akin to him in style, and anyone who
will take the trouble to make a comparison with the Magdalen in the
same room (which is a genuine example), and also with the two pictures
by him at Hampton Court, will be able to convince himself that Sir
Edward Poynter is right in removing the Brescian master’s name from the
catalogue, and more wisely substituting ‘Venetian School.’ Now comes
the Leuchtenberg picture, a comparison with which proves that such
likenesses exist as to exclude all theory of chance resemblance, yet
such differences also exist as to dispel any suspicion that the one may
be a copy of the other. In such cases a common original can usually be
inferred, a deduction which modern archaeologists habitually make in
similar circumstances; and rightly, for a common idea, or conception,
underlies the outward divergencies of detail, so that when the highest
common factor can be found we can reconstruct in idea what such an
original must have been like. Now it is curious that Giorgione’s name
is attached to the Leuchtenberg picture, for anyone at all familiar
with Venetian painting must see at a glance that the style proclaims
a period at least a decade after his death in 1510. It is more than
probable that both this picture and that in the National Gallery date
from about 1530 or so. Giorgione cannot possibly have produced either
the one or the other: but is it altogether beyond possibility that
some idea of his may have served as basis for later artists to work
up? Strictly speaking, neither picture is Giorgionesque, except by
reflection, for the dazzling personality of the young Castelfrancan
shed lustre even on the succeeding generation in Venice. In neither
does the painting show much trace of that mysterious glamour which the
master, above all Venetian painters, knew how to impart. Yet in the
romantic rendering of the subject, and in the picturesque treatment
of landscape, we may trace an ultimate connexion with the art of
Giorgione. In neither is the handling so unmistakably individual as to
warrant a positive opinion as to authorship. It is true that several
competent judges profess to recognize the hand of Calisto da Lodi
in the National Gallery picture,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> but further research is needed
before certainty of judgement is reached; and as to the Leuchtenberg
example—well, it matters little whether Beccaruzzi or some other
imitator of better things be the author. Two separate painters have
taken a common theme, they have treated the group of St. Joseph and
the two Shepherds practically alike, and have laid down the outlines
of landscape and architecture in the same way. Each has shown his
independence in the treatment of the Madonna and Child and in the minor
accessories. One of these details in the Leuchtenberg picture shows
the sort of man the painter was, for he has calmly appropriated the
idea of the boy angel playing at the trough, a motive which Titian
first introduced in the world-famous Sacred and Profane Love. He seems
also prone to introduce non-significant detail, such as the dog (very
wooden, by the way) and the elaborate accessories of the ruined stable,
the architecture of which baffles analysis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span> The Magi also appear in
procession, thus distracting attention from the simple theme of the
Adoration of the Shepherds. Yet as a colourist this painter is worthy
of praise, though not such a master of chiaroscuro as his fellow-artist
of the National Gallery. We may say then that the Leuchtenberg
picture adds to the interest attaching to the other, and raises the
question whether some Giorgionesque motive is not at the bottom of the
composition.</p>

two bas-reliefs reproduced were not only known but also celebrated
before they came to the Louvre. The first, a bust and profile,
represents a juvenile figure, almost feminine, clothed in shining
armour, wearing a helmet decorated with a surprising dash and fantasy,
round which may be read this unexpected and rather unusual inscription:
‘P. Scipioni.’ It is not known under what circumstances this was
acquired by M. Paul Rattier, an amateur of Paris. On his death he
bequeathed it to the Louvre with reserve of usufruct on behalf of
his brother. The latter has just died, and the museum thus enters
into absolute possession of the legacy. In the various exhibitions
where this bas-relief has been displayed it has not failed, as may
be imagined, to attract the attention and excite the curiosity of
students and critics. As it recalls by the expression of the face a
great number of Leonardo’s figures and, in the decoration of the armour
and the helmet, motives frequent in the work of the master, notably
the celebrated warrior in the Malcolm collection, we think firstly
and very naturally of Leonardo da Vinci. We know, too, that he was
a sculptor as well as a painter; he himself says expressly in his
treatise on painting that, having practised the two arts with equal
care, he has a good foundation for pronouncing on the difficulties of
both. But we know of no authentic sculpture from his hand which could
serve as a starting-point or as a means of comparison for the purpose
of making a decisive attribution. Is the St. John the Baptist in the
South Kensington Museum, which came from the Gigli Campana collection,
really from his hand? No one can prove it. And of the busts of children
and women which, according to Vasari, he executed in clay (‘Facendo
nella sua giovanezza di terra alcune teste di femine che ridono, che
vanno formate per l’&#160;arte di gesso, e parimente teste di putti che
parevano usciti di mano d’&#160;un maestro’), none have come down to us. ¶
Bode, who was the first to pronounce the name of Leonardo in connexion
with the Scipio of the Rattier collection, proposed, afterwards, that
of his master Verrochio. The reasons which prompted him are as follows:
Vasari has told us that Verrochio had made ‘due teste di metallo; una
d’Alessandro Magno <i>in profilo</i>; l’&#160;altro d’&#160;un Dario, a suo
capriccio, pur di mezzo rilievo, e ciascuno da per se, variando l’
un dall’&#160;altro ne cimieri, nell armadura od in ogni cosa; le quali
amendue furono mandate dal magnifico Lorenzo vecchio de’ Medici al re
Mattia Corvino in Ungharia, con molte altre cose....’ Why should not
the Scipio belong to the same series? The ornamentation of the helmet,
the design of the streamers which decorate it, especially the modelling
of the mouth, do they not recall other works of Verrochio, and notably
the execution of the mouth of his David? These arguments, no matter
on what authority we have them, are not decisive. Courajod, Muntz,
Muller-Walde, and the latest historian of Verrochio, M. Mackowsky,
incline rather towards maintaining the name of Leonardo da Vinci or of
his school. All that can be said with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
certainty is, that the sculptor who turned out this brilliant piece of
work must have been a very skilful decorative artist, and that he was
evidently inspired by the achievements and the spirit of the master.
But it would be very rash to assert that the hand of Leonardo himself
worked this marble.</p>

</div>

<p>If There does not seem any possibility for doubt
or difference of opinion with regard to the attribution of the other
bas-relief which, only a few days after the arrival of the Scipio, was
acquired by the museum. To him who has seen the interior decoration
of the temple of Rimini, the front of San Bernardino at Perugia, and
the Madonna of the Opera di Duomo at Florence, the name of Agostino di
Duccio invincibly presents itself. This bas-relief was found framed,
over an altar, in the wall of a little church in the department of the
Oise, a dependent of the commune of Neuilly-sous-Clermont. This rural
church was originally the chapel belonging to the chateau of Auvillers,
which belongs to the family of Bonnières-de-Wierre. One of the general
officers of Bonaparte’s army was a member of this family, and brought
this precious bas-relief home with him (the archives of the family
might possibly reveal to us the place and the circumstances under which
he found it), and he placed it in the chapel belonging to the chateau.
It was thence that the Louvre, with the consent of the members of the
family of Bonnières and of the commune, acquired it. A former lamented
head of the department of Mediaeval and Renaissance Sculpture, Louis
Courajod, published, in 1892, in the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i>, an
account of this charming piece of sculpture, and, to put it out of the
reach of any attempts that might be made by collectors or merchants, he
had it placed on the list of historical monuments. Events have proved
that this was not an unnecessary precaution; however, the admission of
this bas-relief into the Louvre puts a stop to all competition.</p>

</div>

<p class="p0"><span class="hide-first2">T</span><span class="smaller">HESE</span> two remarkable and curious pictures appear to us likely to
interest students of mediaeval painting. They are painted on thin
panels measuring 12⅛ ins. by 7⅞ ins. The wood has first been covered
with a rather coarse canvas, over which the usual gesso ground has been
laid; directly on this, and without the usual preparation of bole,
gold leaf was laid over the whole surface. The gold is elaborately
tooled in the halos and crowns. The pictures are painted in tempera
over the gold ground. The handiwork is of exceptional fineness, the
hatchings being extremely minute, and the whole is wrought to an
enamelled surface of extreme beauty. I can recall only one other work
in which quite the same minuteness and perfection of surface quality
are attained, and that is the Richard II diptych at Wilton House, which
indeed surpasses the present examples. Unfortunately the tempera has
not adhered perfectly to the gold, and in many places only a trace
of colour is left; the faces are, however, for the most part intact.
¶ This somewhat lengthy description of the methods employed in these
pictures may not be without value in view of the attempt to determine
the origin of these curious and unusual works. Many characteristics of
the pictures seem to point to a Siennese origin, such, for instance, as
the tooling of the halos, which may be almost be matched in the works
of Ceccharelli and Vanni; the Madonna’s face seems like a vulgarized
version of Simone Martini’s type, while the treatment of the hair by
separate, rather thick, continuous, and parallel lines of light is
such as we find frequently in Siennese art. The seated figures in
the Dormition of the Virgin, again, if not distinctly Siennese are
decidedly Italian, and are among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span> the common properties of Giotto’s
heirs. Italian, again, is the appearance of the inlaid woodwork of the
bed-stand. The use of a canvas basis for the gesso ground is, too, in
Italy, a peculiarly Siennese tradition, though it is there only a late
survival of what was probably a universal practice. On the other hand
the absence of a bole foundation for the gilding is quite unlike the
practice of any Italian painters. Again, the types with their heavily
modelled features, their full round staring eyes and protruding noses,
seem to suggest a northern origin for these works. No less distinctive
is the colour. The chief characteristic of this is the extraordinary
brilliance and purity of the local tints, combined with an absence
of any feeling for a distinct colour scheme as opposed to the mere
putting together of agreeable tints. The main notes are an ultramarine
of quite astounding intensity and saturation, a pure deep rose, and
a bright green midway between apple and myrtle green. The flesh is
florid and full coloured without traces of a terra verte foundation
being apparent. These qualities of colour are such as we might expect
from a miniaturist, and other things point to the same conclusion;
first, the extreme minuteness and the marvellous perfection of the
workmanship, then the crowding of the composition, and the elegant but
singularly unstructural disposition of the draperies. Finally, one may
surmise that no artist who was accustomed to work on a large scale
would have made so elementary a blunder in space construction as our
unknown master has in the Adoration of the Magi. The Madonna is clearly
intended to be seated beneath the thatched roof, yet the foremost
support, instead of coming down in front of her knees, is placed behind
her. Such a mistake would be possible, however, to an artist who was
accustomed to the almost hieroglyphic symbolism of miniature painting.
¶ Taking all these points into consideration I think it most probable
that we have here two of the rare and singularly beautiful works of
the French school of painting of the fourteenth century. This is made
probable most of all by the colouring. This intense ultramarine never
occurs in Italian work, but is to be found in the paintings attributed
to Jean Malouel in the Louvre. It indeed remained endemic in French
art, for we find it in many miniaturists, and something not unlike
it turns up again in the work of Ingres. There is, moreover, in the
Louvre a small picture, No. 997, representing the Entombment, in which
not only does the same blue appear, but united with the same deep
rose and vivid myrtle green. It has also the same rare perfection of
surface quality, the same even, hard smalto. This picture is no doubt
rightly attributed to the French school of the end of the fourteenth
century. But neither this nor any other French picture in the Louvre
shows so strong an Italian influence as our panels do, and it is partly
for their interest as yet another proof of the constant interchange
of ideas between Italy and the North about this period that we give
them publicity. Of such intercourse there are, of course, already
many proofs in the work of painters like Enguerrand de Charenton, of
Fouquet, and most remarkable of all in a miniature by Pol de Limbourg,
which is a free copy of a fresco by Taddeo Gaddi in Santa Croce at
Florence.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hide-first2">B</span><span class="smaller">ORN</span> towards 1515, either at Paris or Loué, and dying only in 1590,
Germain Pilon lived through a momentous century in the history of
France. The native art, so prolific during the two preceding centuries,
which commands our admiration to-day by its originality and simplicity,
was essentially French in feeling and execution, but towards the close
of the fifteenth century the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
all-powerful influence of the great Italians manifested itself,
partly by the general spread of knowledge which noised abroad the
fame of achievements in Italy to which the civilized world was then
paying homage, and again by the migration of Italian artists to
adjacent countries, which, in the majority of cases, received them
with acclamation.</p>

<p>In one way this had a beneficial effect upon the
productions of the northern countries, for it incited a spirit of
emulation laudable in the extreme, but it was also the cause of a
decline in native resourcefulness and originality due to an unduly
thorough assimilation of Italian methods and aims. The result of this
was a strange co-mingling of Italian and native ideas and technique
producing an eclecticism which robbed art somewhat of the virility
apparent in the creations of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
Still, side by side with this we have a growing tendency to tenderness
and sympathetic treatment quite in keeping with the lofty aims of the
sixteenth century, which compensates to some extent for the loss of
robustness and impetuous energy. ¶ In such a condition did Pilon find
art in France, when, leaving his father, also a sculptor, with whom he
had hitherto collaborated, he came to Paris about 1550, and here we
find him, in conjunction with Pierre Bontemps and Ambrose Perret, at
work upon the tomb of François I, which had been designed by Philibert
Delorme. After the designs of the latter Pilon was employed from
1560 to 1565 upon the well-known tomb at Saint-Denis of Henri II and
Catherine de Médicis, which must be counted amongst his most important
achievements. For the King and Queen he executed about this time
the fine group of Les Trois Grâces in the Louvre, which represents,
perhaps, the culminating point of his genius, and is manifestly
superior both in elegance of contour and in technical qualities to
Les Trois Parques ascribed to him which has found a permanent resting
place in the Hôtel de Cluny. In Les Trois Grâces he presents to us
the culmination of the French Renaissance in sculpture; the rhythm
and balance of the composition is aided by the superb technique
displayed in the modelling of the well-chosen figures, and a further
beauty is added by the grace with which they support the urn. ¶ But
quite equal to any single figure is the fine example of Pilon’s art
which we illustrate this month by permission of Mr. E. Lowengard, its
present owner. It represents as an emblematical figure of Charity a
tall and dignified woman holding a child to her breast with the right
hand, whilst the left, with protecting care, sustains another, which
is clinging to her mantle; a third stands at her feet with a look of
trustful assurance upon its upturned face. The head of Charity is
crowned with laurel. The drapery is entirely characteristic of Pilon at
his best; while not unduly severe, it does not err in being too florid,
a failing of Pilon on many occasions. Moreover, it fully illustrates
the French master’s profound knowledge of anatomy, a study in which he
easily outstripped most of his contemporaries. It is open to question
whether such an important and characteristic example of Pilon’s
work has been seen in London before, and its presence at the moment
furnishes an admirable opportunity of studying the style of this master.</p>

</div>

<p class="p0"><span class="hide-first2">T</span><span class="smaller">HE</span> lace of Mrs. Alfred Morrison at Fonthill House is of special
interest among private collections. Mrs. Morrison has long interested
herself in the exertions of M. M. Lefébure, the Honiton revival by the
late Mrs. Treadwin of Exeter, and even the crochet work of Ireland, and
has in many cases supplied designs, or suggestions for design, to these
centres; hence, with her well-known collection of antique lace she has
included the best of its modern derivatives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span> and modern design. Among
the specimens illustrated are:—</p>

<p>Plate I: (1) A curious example of a rare type of <i>lace made in
Russia</i>, consisting of a scarf with arms worked upon either end.
This lace was made in the early part of the nineteenth century
(when needle-point was first introduced into Moscow) at a private
lace school. The design, which is upon net, and very unlike the
characteristic Russian vermiculate patterns with their oriental
character and occasional colouring, consists of a chain of <i>jours</i>
enclosing coarse, simple, and prominent fillings similar to those
of provincial pillow-laces of England and France, and a <i>semé</i>
of small sprigs. Although the workmanship is even throughout, the
drawing is so <i>naïve</i> as to suggest that the lace-worker was
unused to that type of lace. There is a border of similar <i>jours</i>
alternating with small leaves and sprays.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Gros point de Venise.</i>—In the central strip of this lace
very few brides have been introduced, and only so far as is necessary
for strength, and those used are plain. The <i>bride</i> work forms
no essential part of the design, the parts of the pattern being
chiefly held together by being worked in contact with one another. In
the joined border, which is of later date, the work, and especially
the raised scallops, is of a superior evenness and regularity. Short
<i>brides</i>, both plain and <i>picotées</i>, connect the design,
which is closer and more florid, and remarkable for the compact, firm
character which careful and precise workmanship has given to the piece,
as it were <i>scolpito in rilievo</i>.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Point de Venise.</i>—Two long strips (3½ inches wide) of
excellent and open scroll and floral design. The <i>brides</i> which
connect the design are decorated with small stars and whirls. Upon some
of the raised borders are set small scallops, or picots. Seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Alençon lappet</i>, a design of interlacing ribbons, filled
in with light modes, enclosing a small ornament. Eighteenth century.
Period, Louis XV.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Modern Irish Needle-point lace, à brides picotées</i>, specially
made and designed for Mrs. Alfred Morrison [very much reduced].
Nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Plate II: (1) <i>Brussels veil</i> (three sides of which are
ornamented, the fourth being plain), containing floral devices made in
pillow, and applied to pillow-made mesh grounds. The softness of the
grounds, the workmanship of the flowers, of which the cordonnets have
little or no relief, the lightness of the fillings of the modes, place
these Brussels points in a category quite distinct from any other lace.
The design is of light leafy festoons of roses and forget-me-nots. In
the corner is an urn-shaped ornament with lateral festoons. The border
has a scalloped edge. Throughout the veil are pillow renderings of
various <i>modes</i>, the <i>réseau rosacé</i>, star devices, etc.
Eighteenth century.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Honiton lace</i>, made by the late Mrs. Treadwin of Exeter, from
an old design. The pattern is connected by small brides covered with a
number of small picots.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Rose point à brides</i> (<i>Venetian</i>), of close workmanship,
in silk (natural-coloured). The free use of ornate picots clustering
upon flying loops edging the scallops, as well as upon the brides, is
noticeable. The <i>brides</i> are thickly ornamented with stars and
whirls. [This sort of lace is sometimes called <i>point de neige</i>,
probably on account of its snowy appearance.] The stems of the pattern
are of light work, and not strengthened on the edge by an outer
cordonnet or button-hole stitched work. Seventeenth century.</p>

<p>A very similar specimen of Venetian needle-point lace in silk is to be
seen at the Victoria and Albert Museum [835–’68]. It is also square
and of similar size and date, and is also remarkable for the series of
scallops and picots upon the raised portions of the design. The design
of this specimen ‘consists of a symmetrical distribution of floral
forms grouped about an ornamental arrangement in the centre.’ It was
probably a ‘pall’&#160;or covering for a chalice or sacramental cup. Though
Mrs. Morrison’s specimen is said
to be of Jewish work, and used in the synagogue to cover the law, it is
more probable that it is a ‘pall,’ like the above-mentioned example.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Drawn thread-work</i> [<i>Turkish?</i>].</p>

<p>(5) <i>Point de Venise, period Louis XIII.</i>—A conventional design
somewhat resembling Italian Renaissance ironwork. The pattern and some
of the short brides which connect it are ornamented with picots, giving
lightness and variety to the work.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Irish crochet lace</i>, specially made for Mrs. Alfred Morrison,
adapted from the above design, which it well reproduces. An experiment
in improving the spiritless and confused effect of Irish crochet, where
conventional <i>motifs</i> are fitted together without any pre-arranged
design. In natural-coloured silk.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Imitation point d‘Alençon.</i>—The ground or <i>réseau</i> of
this piece is a very wide-meshed knotted net of coarse thread. A stiff
and simple flower issuing from a horn or vase is set in the centre of
a waved diamond-shaped compartment. The flowers are filled in with
small pieces of coarse linen, and are <i>appliqué</i> to the net by
stitches which hold the twisted thread outlines—the substitute for the
cordonnet of button-hole stitches in the Alençon it imitates—to the
little bits of linen.</p>

<p>Plate III: (1) Embroidered <i>Turkish drawn thread work</i>.—An
eight-pointed star within the centre of which is a circle of
drawn-work, of which the threads are overcast with fine button-hole
stitches.</p>

<p>(2) The old conventional cut-work of Italy; <i>Reticella</i>, with
<i>punto in aria</i> vandykes attached. <i>Reticella</i> differs from
cutwork in that, though it also is worked on a linen foundation,
the linen has almost entirely disappeared. The threads left as the
framework of the design, dividing it into square compartments, are
closely covered with stitches. Into these squares are introduced
geometrical forms (star-forms) set in circles and enriched with
patterns in solid needlework. This lace is frequently called <i>Greek
lace</i>, principally owing to the fact that a great deal was found
during the occupation of the Ionian islands by the English. It is,
however, undoubtedly Italian in origin. The lace is shown upon the
linen on which it is made; most specimens have been cut off for sale
from the original linen ground. The <i>punto in aria</i> vandykes
developed from the <i>reticella</i>, and are made with the same
geometrical designs. The pointed edge was worked on threads laid down
in the required shape, and the spaces filled in various designs.
<i>Brides picotées</i> were sparingly added to connect the various
portions of the pattern.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Venetian-made Alençon</i> (Burano).—A design of small sprays
upon mixed grounds. Along the lower portion of the design runs a
twisting ribbon enclosing various <i>à jours</i> and diapered grounds.
The scalloped border shows blossom <i>modes</i> set upon a large
hexagonal mesh <i>picoté</i>, alternating with a scalloped ribbon,
enclosing varieties of diaper-patterned grounds, similar to those to be
seen in the <i>modes</i> of Venetian heavy point laces.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Venetian-made Alençon</i>, design of palm leaves, with
straight-edged border of flowerets and leaves.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Alençon bordering lace</i>, eighteenth century. Period, Louis
XVI.—Under Louis XVI it became the fashion to multiply the number
of flounces to dresses and to gather them into pleats, or, as it was
termed, to <i>badiner</i> them, so that ornamental <i>motifs</i>, more
or less broken up or partially concealed by the pleats, lost their
significance and <i>flow</i>. The spaces between the <i>motifs</i>,
therefore, widened more and more, until the design deteriorated
into <i>semés</i> of small devices, detached flowers, <i>pots</i>,
<i>larmes</i>, or, as in the present design, a dot set within a
rosette. Instead, also, of wreaths, ribands, or festoons undulating
from one side of the border to another, we have a stiff rectilinear
border of purely conventional design. Naturalistic patterns are not met
with in lace of that period.

<p class="p0">The book published by Lady Dilke, at the end of last year, is one of
the most complete and definite works on an important section of our
artistic history that we French possess. For we are marked by this rare
characteristic, that the qualities of our own distinguished men are
most often revealed to us by foreigners. While we have in our midst a
number of specialist writers to instruct us in minute detail concerning
the most trifling acts and deeds of a Fleming or Italian, we lack
historians who will take a general view of our national art. It would
seem that the Frenchman who shall have written a book on the eighteenth
century as full and thorough as Lady Dilke’s is yet to be born. From
time to time men of great attainments have produced a monograph, have
described the work of a Watteau or a Lancret, but this has always
wanted the necessary general commentary, the linking with general
history, the grouping of facts, which lend so great an attraction to
the works of Lady Dilke. It affords me a two-fold pleasure to say
this, first because I profess a deep and very respectful sympathy for
the author’s person, and secondly because I have always been greatly
touched by the French side of her character. Lady Dilke and I know the
faults of our respective countrymen; we speak of them when necessary;
but we also know our reciprocal good qualities and speak of these too.
Lady Dilke has written in praise of the school of the French Minor
Masters of the eighteenth century with a conviction and an ardour of
which we are very proud, and I feel charged to express to her in this
review our deep-felt gratitude. ¶The difference between England and
ourselves is made manifest from the very first. Whereas with us a more
or less florid, amusing, or, let us say, sensational narrative is in
most cases sufficient to satisfy the French reader, Lady Dilke’s book,
although intended to be read by everybody, does not fear to display
an integral erudition. This handsome and well-illustrated book, while
it gladdens the eyes of a person indifferent to these questions, will
interest profoundly the specialist and the scholar. It contains not
a line unsupported by at least one reference and often by many. All
that the contemporaries of our eighteenth-century artists have left
concerning them, all records of inventories and even judicial notes,
have been read and employed in their season by their kindly historian.
It is easy to read into the impartial, nicely-turned, but apparently
impassive text a genuine woman’s admiration for these feminine, evasive
and exquisite artists; but the passion is restrained and displays
itself only at the last. When the author is occasionally obliged to
lament certain rather gross errors, she does so with filial moderation,
with that which a child might show towards its grandfather; and we have
learnt all, we are able to deplore all, while not one serious word of
blame shall have fallen from the historian’s pen. ¶ Lady Dilke divides
her work into eleven chapters, each bearing the name of an art-lover or
artist. The first of these chapters is devoted to the Comte de Caylus
and the great amateurs. For, though the collectors date very far back,
the ‘amateur,’ in the French and modern sense of the word, came into
being together with the speculations of Law. There is a singular and
never-changing agreement between the rabid collector and the stock
jobbing financier; it is as though the man who had grown suddenly
rich wished to find no less suddenly in his new palace the ancestral
elegance of the man of quality. ¶ Lady Dilke has selected the Comte de
Caylus because he exercised an enormous influence upon the whole of the
eighteenth century. Himself an engraver—though of no great merit—he
was the cause that men and women of the world amused themselves with
the pastime, that Madame de Pompadour tried her hand at engraving,
and that, trying her hand, but with only slight success, she favoured
to an extreme degree the artist-engravers of her time. ¶ The second
chapter is devoted to those lovers of engravings, the print-collectors
Mariette and Basan, who, for the rest, had no great affection for the
artists of their time, but who favoured the iconographic movement.
¶ The typical French engraver of the eighteenth century is Charles
Nicolas Cochin, who was known as the Chevalier Cochin. Cochin, through
his family, his connexions and his works, touches every section of
society. He belongs to the Court, to the nobility, to the middle
class. His mother was a Horthemels; his sisters were Mesdames Tardieu
and Belle. Cochin was trained in the school of different masters; he
shows traces of Watteau, Gillot, Chardin and Detroy. But he is above
all himself; his mind is composed of a thousand amiable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span> witty, and
refined things; his art is the very spirit of a nation; and it is not
too much to say that in him French art is summed up. ¶ The men whom
Lady Dilke studies in Chapter IV of her book, the engravers Drevet and
Daullé, are different people. They descend from the great century; they
go back by easy degrees to Louis XIV and those famous artists, Audran,
Nanteuil and Edelinck. But, though they have style and even majesty,
they have neither the charm nor the grace of their contemporaries. This
is also, to a certain extent, the case with Wille, who came to France
to learn and who borrowed from us only the solemn and majestic side
of the great masters. ¶ Lady Dilke studies in succession the Laurent
Cars, the Le Bas, and, lastly, Gravelot. Gravelot the author regards
almost in the light of a fellow-countryman. The greater part of his
career was spent in London. We know that, in so far as this part is
concerned, the author is in possession of even still more varied and
personal notes. From Gravelot to Eisen, from the “Opera de Flora” to
the “Contes de Lafontaine,” is an imperceptible transition. And thus we
come to the masters of the end of the century, to Moreau the younger
in particular, who presents its definite synthesis, linked as he is to
Cochin by the brothers Saint-Aubin, the “exquisite poets of the most
charming decadence.” ¶ Finally, Lady Dilke speaks of the engravers in
colours, of those men, such as Demarteau, Debucourt, and others, who,
without eclipsing their English colleagues, keep step with them. And
then we come to the relations of the engravers with the Academy. Here,
what severity is shown! On one occasion, the engraver Balechou, who is
a member of the Academy, engraves a full-length portrait of the King of
Poland, Augustus III. He had promised not to pull a separate proof of
it. Having done so in one single case—this proof is still preserved
in the Paris Print-room—he was struck off the list of Academicians.
¶ It is impossible, in a short review, to set forth in detail the
importance of a book of this kind. We need this book in France, and it
is to be hoped that one of our publishers will issue a translation,
because it is a revelation to us. The English publisher has undoubtedly
produced a practical and easily-handled book, but his reproductions are
a little inferior in quality, given the value of the work. It would
have been desirable that all the illustrations should have taken the
form of heliogravures. Nevertheless, and putting this little criticism
on one side, Lady Dilke’s book is, sincerely speaking, the newest and
most “encyclopaedic” work that we at present possess on the French
draughtsmen and engravers of the eighteenth century.</p>

Edited by Lionel Cust, M.V.O., F.S.A. Cassell.</h3>

<p class="p0">It was a happy thought of Messrs. Cassell to issue an illustrated
catalogue of the National Portrait Gallery similar to that of the
National Gallery. The Portrait Gallery, in spite of great difficulties
in the matter of space and funds, has become a place of which the
nation may well be proud. It already contains a series of British
portraits which if not absolutely complete, is at least representative,
sensibly arranged, and catalogued with much more fullness and accuracy
than some better endowed collections. One or two possible improvements
may suggest themselves to the outsider—the addition, for instance, of
photographs (we hear that some arrangement of this kind is actually
contemplated) or careful copies of unique portraits of famous men
which can never leave their present owners. The colleges of Oxford
and Cambridge contain several pictures which would fill gaps in the
Gallery, and other works in private hands are equally desirable.
Nevertheless, the National Portrait Gallery, like the British Museum,
has hitherto been so fortunate in its directors that there is no
reason for regarding its future with serious anxiety. ¶ Nor can we be
surprised that Mr. Cust, who has had so much to do with the well-being
of the Portrait Gallery, has edited its illustrated catalogue on
thoroughly sound lines. To precisians a chronological arrangement may
seem to have disadvantages. These disadvantages, in our opinion, are
minimized by the addition of an index of portraits and an index of
artists, while the grouping together of men of the same generation,
family, or profession, has the enormous advantage of making the book
a thing attractive both to the casual reader and to the student of
history, instead of a dry alphabetical list. ¶ We have only one fault
to find with the abbreviated biographies which Mr. Cust supplies. They
are laudably impartial, but the impartiality is sometimes carried
to an extreme which places a second-rate man on the same level as a
first-rate one. ¶ As a rule, a very wise discretion has been exercised
in reproducing the pictures on a scale proportionate to their actual
size and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span> importance, so that the defects which marred the kindred
volumes on the National Gallery have generally been avoided. One or two
exceptions may perhaps be noted. We do not, for instance, think that
justice is done to Kneller’s vivid portrait of the poet Gay (No. 622)
by a cut less than two inches in height and less than one and a half
inches in breadth, especially when Mr. Sargent’s portrait of Coventry
Patmore is honoured by a full-page engraving. The juxtaposition of the
two portraits of Sir William Hamilton also is not a success. The figure
by David Allan looks a giant compared with that painted by Reynolds.
¶ The photographing, engraving, and printing of the pictures have on
the whole been so admirably done that we have no more fault to find
with them than with the letterpress or the arrangement of the book. We
notice, indeed, that Kneller is again unfortunate. His portrait of John
Smith, the mezzotint engraver (No. 699), is one of his most masterly
works, showing a grip of character, an artistic taste, and a technical
perfection for which in his Court portraits we seek in vain. In the
reproduction the portrait loses all its spirit and all its quality.
On the other hand, almost all the slight sketches and pencil drawings
in the gallery come out excellently, so that any occasional failure
cannot be attributed to want of care or want of science. ¶ Perhaps,
considering its price, the publishers might have bound the book more
strongly, even if they retained the limp cover which allows the book to
open comfortably. The present paper binding is too flimsy for a book
that has to be used for reference, and to send a work of reference to
the binder often results in deprivation just when one needs the book
most. ¶ These, after all, are minor details. As a whole, the catalogue
is a thoroughly sound piece of work, and does credit to its editor,
publishers, and printers (if not to its binder), and we have no doubt
it will take its place by the Dictionary of National Biography on the
shelves of all who are interested in the past history of the British
race.</p>

1474–1539. A Study of the Renaissance. By Julia Cartwright (Mrs. Ady). John Murray.

<p class="p0">There are three ways of writing history which rejoice all serious
readers and students. The first and best is, alas, rare, for it
requires constructive imagination based on sound scholarship. It
is the history which bestows upon the characters portrayed that
quality which makes them live on in the reader’s mind like great
myths. Gibbon’s ‘Julian,’ Mommsen’s ‘Hannibal,’ Carlyle’s ‘Voltaire,’
Creighton’s ‘Pius II’—to take a very few instances chosen at
random—live on in our imaginations like the heroes of romance, like
Don Quixote, or Julien Sorel, or the ‘Egoist.’ ¶ On the other hand,
there is the work of the mere archivist, the conscientious finder and
transcriber of documents, who leaves the imaginative reconstruction
of character entirely to the reader. For this, too, the student
cannot be too grateful. And then there is the <i>via media</i> of the
gifted compiler, whose efforts are also welcome, provided they are
honest and careful, and free from the taint of journalism. ¶ It is
this middle path that Mrs. Ady is accustomed to take, and always with
peculiar success in her biographies of women. Those who have already
enjoyed her ‘Beatrice d’Este’ will be prepared for finding interest
and pleasure in reading her account of that noble lady’s even more
accomplished and more famous sister, Isabella, marchioness of Mantua,
the leader for more than forty years of the most continuously brilliant
and intellectual court in Italy. Mrs. Ady does not claim originality
of research, but her task of weaving the documentary researches of
others into a readable, accurate, and interesting account is extremely
well done. It is true that she has no great or genial gifts for the
presentment of character, but she knows at least how to describe it
with the appropriate background of historical events and of court and
family life. She has better taste than to make of it a lurid tale,
as some popular writers would have done. Isabella is painted as the
faithful and devoted wife and daughter and sister, the careful and
affectionate mother—nay, even the doting grandmother—as well as
the ‘prima donna del mondo,’ the Muse of poets and humanists, the
patroness and friend of great artists, the confidante of popes and
emperors, and the victim, too, of family and political tragedies.
¶ For us in this place, her interest lies chiefly in one aspect of
her many activities—in her relations with the artists of her day.
Her portrait was drawn by Leonardo, and painted by Mantegna, Titian,
Francia, Costa, as well as by various artists of less importance,
such as Maineri and Buonsignori, and her medal was cast in bronze by
the sculptor Cristoforo Romano. She was a passionate collector of
beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span> things, decorating her private apartment with pictures by
Mantegna, Costa, and Perugino, and sending her emissaries over nearly
the whole of Italy to extort from dilatory or overworked painters the
fulfilment of commissions she had given them, getting now a Nativity
from Giovanni Bellini, a Magdalen and a St. Jerome from Titian,
Allegories from Correggio, portraits from Francia, and even from
Raphael himself. She employed Timoteo Viti to make designs for her
majolica dinner-service, and most of the northern sculptors of note
were at one time or another set to work for her. Lorenzo da Pavia
made her priceless viols and lutes of inlaid ivory and ebony, and
Caradosso carved her a wonderful inkstand in ebony and silver, while
the most famous glass-blowers and jewellers of her time contributed
their best efforts to her matchless collection. But even dearer to
her than contemporary art was the antique, and she spared no pains or
expense, no wiles or selfishness, to get into her possession every
available antique statue or fragment that she heard of. The collector’s
passion was on her, and even her fine taste and that of her cultivated
advisers did not always protect her from the collector’s misfortunes.
In the light of recent revelations, it is amusing to hear how she
was taken in by the forgeries of a certain Roman dealer who bore the
splendid name of Raphael of Urbino, and how this shifty precursor of
many an Italian ‘antiquario’ of to-day managed to get out of giving
her back her money! ¶ Curiously enough, Isabella, although a fast
friend of the Medicean popes and their relatives, seems to have taken
no interest at all in the art of Florence, except in Michelangelo, and
in Leonardo, who came to her, not from Florence, but from Milan. She
sent to Florence, it is true, for a picture, but it was to Perugino
she wrote, and not to any of the great Florentine masters. ¶ Mrs. Ady
has tried to trace carefully the present whereabouts of Isabella’s
portraits and possessions, but we miss in the index any assembling of
her scattered remarks on this interesting subject. The Leonardo pastel
sketch (reproduced as frontispiece to Vol. I, but wrongly described
as red chalk) is well known in the Louvre; one of the Titians (the
one copied by Rubens) she identifies in the collection of M. Leopold
Goldschmid at Paris, while the other, in Vienna, is reproduced as the
frontispiece to the second volume. As to the latter, she says it was
painted by Titian after a portrait by Francia, itself not done from
the life, but from sketches and descriptions. If this be indeed the
one referred to, Titian has managed to give no hint of his obligation
to the Bolognese master. The portrait by Maineri, a painter of
Parma, the author suggests as being the same as that in Mrs. Alfred
Morrison’s collection, exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in
1894; but she admits, on the other hand, that this portrait may be
from the hand of Beltraffio, which indeed it clearly is. Although it
has apparently not occurred to Mrs. Ady, is it not possible that the
untraced portrait of Isabella painted by Costa, was, like so many of
her treasures, bought for Charles I, and that it is the Portrait of a
Lady which now hangs in Hampton Court (No. 295)? The face resembles
the one he painted as Isabella’s in the Louvre Allegory, but, on the
other hand, they are both so thoroughly Costa in every detail that
neither can be called real <i>portraits</i> in the modern sense of the
word. The objective photographic style of portraiture in vogue to-day
was quite foreign to the habits of most Renaissance painters, who
were satisfied, once they had found a type that suited them, to stick
to it for everything—Madonnas, portraits of ladies, and allegorical
figures, indifferently. ¶ Perhaps the most vivid part of Mrs. Ady’s
book is her description of Isabella’s experiences in that fatal sack
of Rome, which, as Erasmus wrote to her friend Sadoleto, was ‘not the
ruin of one city, but of the whole world.’ Barricaded in the Palazzo
Colonna with three thousand distressed souls under her care, Isabella,
safe in the protection of her son, Ferrante, one of the leaders of
the imperial forces, looked down from her windows with anguish upon
the scenes of horror and vandalism enacted in the streets below. Her
house was the only one in Rome that escaped, except the Cancelleria,
which was occupied by Cardinal Colonna. But except for the irreparable
destruction of so many of the world’s masterpieces of beauty, this and
many another interesting incident in Isabella’s career belong rather to
history than to art.</p>

<h3>F<span class="smaller">RANS</span> H<span class="smaller">ALS</span>. By Gerald
S. Davies, M.A. George Bell and Sons.</h3>

<p class="p0">On comparing the number of monographs that have appeared on other
than Dutch artists with that of books in our possession treating of
Dutch painters, we see that the latter have been allotted but a scanty
measure in literature; indeed, one may go further and say that during
the past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span> twenty years, excepting Rembrandt and a few other great
masters, no extensive and comprehensive work has been written on the
old Dutch painters. For this neglect a very well-founded reason exists:
the native art historians of the Netherlands are still collecting
materials, and cannot as yet think of writing exhaustive books
concerning their great masters; for they are much too well aware of the
vast gaps that are still to be found in their knowledge. This is so in
the case, among others, of Frans Hals, and it will remain so for many
years to come; we must needs wait until all the records are accessible
before being able to arrive at a definite knowledge of Hals’s
personality. ¶ Mr. Davies has been deterred by no such considerations;
he not only, with a ready pen, describes Hals’s life and works, but,
thanks to the spacious manner in which he conceives his subject, finds
occasion to indulge in digressions on old Dutch conditions, art and so
forth, which might undoubtedly possess an interest for English readers
if they were correct, but that, unfortunately, is far from being
always the case. ¶ After treating in his first two chapters of the
‘Rise of a National Art’ and ‘Holland and its Art in the Seventeenth
Century’ the author collects the few known facts concerning Hals’s
life in Chapter III, and endeavours to draw a conclusion touching his
personality. We quite admit that legend may have represented Hals
as being a more dissolute man than he actually was. Nevertheless,
one who ill-treated his wife as he did can really not have had any
particularly aristocratic manners. It would be better for us to say
that we do not know enough about his life to be able to white-wash it
of the few disagreeable facts that have been handed down to us. There
can be no doubt, however, that he was a Bohemian, as Mr. Davies rightly
characterizes him. ¶ The following chapters are devoted entirely to
Hals’s artistic career and works; those preserved at Haarlem of course
occupying a great place. The description of these is a lively one,
and is evidently based upon a repeated examination. There are a good
index, bibliography, useful indications such as the approximate dates
of Hals’s life and of his principal paintings, etc. In a word, the
writer has industriously brought together all that he has been able
to ascertain touching his subject from books and pictures. But there
is one matter in which Mr. Davies has not succeeded, and that is the
producing of a critical work. It is true that he himself expressly
says this as regards the catalogue,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> but he constantly makes the
same mistakes in the text itself. This is an exceedingly dangerous
standpoint; for, thanks to it, so soon as one sets to work on a
scientific basis, one finds him, for instance, describing two pictures
(Illustrations Nos. 1 and 54) as Portraits of the Painter which do not
represent Hals at all, while, again, the Portrait of Admiral de Ruyter
(Illustration No. 55) is not a picture of that admiral. ¶ In the same
way, the catalogue—which, from the very nature of the standpoint of
the writer, is incomplete—contains childish mistakes, which are due to
a lack of adequate critical knowledge. For to say of the Hille Bobbe
with a young man smoking behind her, merely that it is ‘generally
recognized as the work of F. Hals the son’ surely denotes an excess of
caution, considering that it is established beyond all doubt that this
picture was, in fact, painted by the son, and therefore it ought not to
have been included in the catalogue. Some of the paintings in English
collections which we missed in the catalogue we were fortunate enough
to find mentioned in the ‘List of Pictures which have appeared ... in
the Winter Exhibitions ... at Burlington House,’ which is inserted
after the ‘List of Works.’ But these data are also, we regret to say,
uncritical. We also searched the catalogue in vain for the oldest
dated portrait by Frans Hals, namely, that of Scriverius, dated 1613,
which forms part of the Warneck Collection in Paris, although it is
mentioned by the author on pp. 27, 29, 84, and 96 of the text. Again,
we find no mention of the delightful Portrait of a Man<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> in the Van
Lynden collection, at present lent to the Mauritshuis at the Hague,
nor of various other pieces.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> As regards the drawings, there is no
doubt whatever that the drawing in the British Museum is an original
Hals. There are more of this sort, and we are sorry not to find them
mentioned in Mr. Davies’s book. ¶ We must deliver ourselves of one or
two further remarks, not from any love of fault-finding, but to remove
mistaken ideas. The picture mentioned on p. 22, which is traditionally,
and by Mr. Davies, supposed to represent Hals’s workshop, was painted
by Michiel Sweerts, and has nothing to do with Hals’s workshop. Nor is
what the author observes touching Hals’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span> manner of painting (p. 124)
quite correct. Hals slowly perfected his technique, proceeding along
a road which is quite easily traced. It is true that he underpainted
a considerable number of his pictures, but there are also many, very
many indeed, which he finished at once, in the wet paint, without
the least underpainting. One of the best examples of the latter is
the Portrait of a Man, in Lord Spencer’s collection, which is at
present in the Guildhall Exhibition. ¶ Mr. Davies’s book has been very
handsomely printed and produced, and is filled with mostly satisfactory
illustrations. It is to be regretted that the contents of the book are
not more worthy of its format; as a critical guide to the art of Frans
Hals it is wholly untrustworthy.</p>

<p class="p0">G<span class="smaller">AZETTE DES</span>
B<span class="smaller">EAUX</span> A<span class="smaller">RTS</span>.—The April number opens with an
article by M. Salomon Reinach, in which he brings to light a great
unknown miniaturist whom he identifies with the painter Simon Marmion,
known as the author of the altarpiece of St. Bertin, now in the castle
of Wied. Of this magnificent and little-known work the National Gallery
possesses two fragments representing a chorus of angels rejoicing
at the birth of the saint and two angels carrying his soul up to
heaven, a strange and imaginative composition, in which the ridge of
a roof cutting into the base of the composition gives an effect of
supernatural strangeness. The manuscript in which the miniatures in
question occur is in the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg, and has
remained till now unnoticed. It is in the main the French compilation
entitled the ‘Grandes Chroniques de Saint-Denys,’ but the history is
continued with extracts from various historians to the beginning of the
reign of Charles V. It contains fifteen full-page miniatures which are
of quite extraordinary merit, and which may be by Simon Marmion. The
smaller miniatures are by another hand, and are distinctly inferior.
The most interesting of the miniatures is the title-page representing
Fillastre, Abbot of St. Bertin, offering the Grandes Chroniques to
Philippe le Bon of Burgundy, by whose side stands the aged Chancellor
Rollin; behind stand three figures, among which M. Reinach recognizes
the youthful Charles the Bold and the Grand Bâtard. The heads are
admirably rendered, and show that Marmion, if it be indeed he, must be
reckoned as one of the great masters of portraiture of a school in
which portraiture attained to the utmost perfection. The landscapes
are, however, scarcely less remarkable. They do not, of course, rise
quite to the height of imaginative realism shown in the Hubert van
Eyck miniatures published by M. Durrieu, but they are conceived in
a similar vein and executed with absolute mastery. If M. Reinach’s
conjecture is correct, and it rests on a number of subsidiary proofs
besides the likeness of style to the Wied altarpiece, he has done a
great service in bringing to light the work of a great artist whose
reputation as a miniaturist was such that his name was coupled with
that of Fouquet in the eulogies of contemporary poets. Marmion was
born at Amiens about 1420. In 1454 he was at Lille employed by the
Duke of Burgundy, but he seems to have worked chiefly at Valenciennes.
His style shows the influence of the Van Eycks, and still more of Van
der Weyden. But there is, we think, in his manner of composition,
and in the freedom of his fancy, something which distinguishes him
from the pure Flemish painters, something which is due to his French
origin and early training. ¶ The next article by M. Casimir Stryienski
is concerned with French art of a very different kind. There exist a
number of catalogues of the early exhibitions of the Salon, illustrated
throughout with minute sketches by Gabriel de St. Aubin. The author has
had the idea of reconstructing by the aid of one of these catalogues
the Salon of 1761, and discussing the subsequent history of the various
works. Many of these are quite lost, and survive only in St. Aubin’s
marvellous sketches. Delicate as St. Aubin’s more serious work is,
as a <i>tour de force</i> nothing could equal the dexterity of these
minute notes. Between two lines of the catalogue he will insert a
whole row of sketches, in which not only the composition but some
suggestion of the chiaroscuro of the originals is given. Many of the
works of Vien, J. B. M. Pierre, Vanloo, and Hallé make a more pleasing
impression when interpreted thus than the originals can have done. ¶
M. André Michel, who carries on the work inaugurated by the genius of
Courajod, commences a series of articles on the acquisitions made by
his department of the Louvre. The finest of these came from Courajod’s
collection, and include a wooden crucifix of the twelfth century,
in which we can trace the first germs of the new sentiment for life
and dramatic expressiveness working in the old hieratic formula. The
exquisite statue of a man of the thirteenth century, also in wood,
shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span> the new art arrived already at perfect command of the means of
expression, but still restrained by a reminiscence of earlier schematic
treatment. This and the stone statue of St. Geneviève show French
sculpture at a point which it has never surpassed. The fifteenth and
sixteenth century sculptures which have been added to the national
collection, though of great beauty, have nothing of the supreme sense
of design of the earlier work. ¶ M. F. de Mely publishes two sarcophagi
with figures in relief discovered at Carthage. In spite of Greek and
Egyptian influences the author considers that at least one of the
figures, that of the priestess, bears the impress of a special racial
type, and he considers that this and the Elche head taken together
give us an idea of a distinctively Punic ideal type. M. Pierre Gusman
describes, without adding anything very new, the Villa Madama, and
M. André Pascal begins an account of the eighteenth century sculptor
Pierre Julien.</p>

<p>In the May number Monsieur Gaston Migeon, who has done much towards the
classification of Mahommedan copper work, writes on the Exhibition of
Mahommedan Art recently held at the Union Centrale des Arts Décoratifs
in the Pavillon de Marson. Several remarkable specimens of copper work
are reproduced, perhaps the most interesting being that lent by M.
Sarre which is supposed to date from the first years of the Hegira,
and to be of Sassanian workmanship. Some fourteenth-century Persian
velvets and tissues of singularly fine and naturalistic design are
also figured, as well as two splendid Indo-Persian miniatures from the
collection of M. Bing. ¶ In his second and concluding article on the
acquisition of the department of sculpture in the Louvre, M. André
Michel describes a remarkable polychrome wooden statue of the beginning
of the sixteenth century belonging to the Franconian school. In this
the author finds the influence of Albert Dürer. It is certainly a more
deliberate and scientific work of art than the majority of Franconian
sculptures of the period. Several works by Houdon, Deseine and Clodion
are also described and reproduced. The prints of the Dutuit Collection
are described in a brilliant and humorous article by M. Henri Bouchot,
in which he concerns himself more with the collector than the
collection, which is in fact rather remarkable for the number of prints
of ascertained pedigree than for its artistic character. M. Pascal
completes in this number his study of Pierre Julien.</p>

DES</span> A<span class="smaller">LLERHÖCHSTEN</span>
K<span class="smaller">AISERHAUSES</span>. Band XXIII, Heft 5.—The present fascicule is
devoted entirely to researches by Herr Julius von Schlosser on
‘Artistic Tradition in the late Middle Ages.’ Under this title the
author brings together several separate researches; the connexion
between them lies in their illustration of the contrast between
mediaeval art with its direct visual symbolizing of ideas and the
Renaissance and modern habits of actual imitation of natural forms.
¶ The first of his researches is concerned with a large illuminated
parchment, too large to have formed part of a book and probably
meant to be framed and hung on a wall. It depicts in the centre the
Nativity, around which, in a large number of medallions enclosed in
late Gothic scrollwork, are represented the various analogies by which
the immaculate conception was rendered credible. It is an early example
of the ‘Defensorium inviolatae virginitatis beatae Mariae,’ in which
the miracle is rendered plausible by a record of all the miraculous
things in nature. The origin and propagation of this popular form of
doctrinal exegesis is discussed. The author of the ‘Defensorium,’
Franciscus of Retz, was a Dominican, and professed theology in the
University of Vienna from 1385 to 1411. The earliest illustrated
version is the manuscript of Frater Antonius of Tegernsee of 1459, and
the work was published as a block-book as early as 1470. The best-known
is Eysenhut’s block-book of 1471, of which the British Museum possesses
a copy. In the early sixteenth century it was published also in a
French translation at Rouen, but it was most popular in Bavaria and
Austria. The parchment picture of the Vienna Hofmuseum, which forms
the subject of these researches, is, the author considers, by an
Austrian artist of the latter half of the fifteenth century. ¶ Of
greater artistic merit are the small folding tablets of the Vienna
Hofmuseum, in which are depicted a series of men and animals which
served as patterns for artists. There are, for instance, the heads of
Christ, the Virgin, and St. John, in poses which show that they would
serve for a Crucifixion; there is the Veronica, and a number of varied
types which experience and tradition showed were likely to be useful
to an artist. It is certainly a striking example of the essentially
practical methods of artistic production at a time when painting was
an actual necessity, and when, therefore, the picture was of more
importance than the artist’s personality. This work belongs to about
the year 1400. ¶ Another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span> artist’s pattern-book discussed by Herr von
Schlosser, though this has already been published in part, is that used
by the miniaturists of a Rhenish monastery, now in the Hofbibliothek at
Vienna. This contains, besides initials and borders, the traditional
receipts for various animals both real and fabulous. This the author
compares with Villars de Honnecourt’s famous sketch-book and the
similar pattern-book of Stephen of Urach in Munich. Villars de
Honnecourt, however earlier in date, had indeed much more than a merely
practical aim in view. He had already begun those researches into the
laws of proportion and harmony in natural form which later on absorbed
Leonardo da Vinci and Dürer. ¶ Herr von Schlosser aptly concludes this
part of his researches by a reproduction of an Attic vase in Berlin,
on which is represented the workshop of a vase maker with the pattern
receipts for gods and animals hanging on the wall. ¶ Finally, in an
appendix, Herr von Schlosser discusses Giusto of Padua’s frescoes
of the virtues in the Eremitani at Padua, which have recently been
relieved in part of their covering of whitewash. He reproduces the two
best preserved figures. Here again the question is of the rôle played
by a traditional pattern-book, for there exist similar representations
of the virtues in manuscripts at Florence and Vienna, while recently
Signor Venturi has acquired for the national collection at Rome another
version, which he considers is Giusto of Padua’s own sketch-book
and the model for the frescoes. Herr von Schlosser shows, we think
conclusively, that this is of later origin by a belated Giottesque of
the early fifteenth century, while he brings forward as the original
of the whole series a MS. at Chantilly by Bartolommeo de’ Bartoli,
executed in all probability between 1353 and 1356 in Bologna.</p>

<p class="p0 mtop2">R<span class="smaller">EPERTORIUM FÜR</span>
K<span class="smaller">UNSTWISSENSCHAFT</span>. 1903. Part II.—Constantin
Winterberg continues his minute analysis of Albert Dürer’s theory
of the proportions of the figure. In this article he deals with the
second book, and shows how Dürer freed himself increasingly from the
traditional mediaeval canon and sought to establish his theory on
inductive lines. ¶ Mr. Campbell Dodgson publishes a transcript of David
de Necker’s preface to the Landsknechts, from which it appears that
the original drawings were by Hans Burkmair, Christopher Amberger,
and Jörg Breu, and were engraved by Jost de Necker, David’s father.
This settles a much-disputed point, and shows that Beham, to whom a
number of the originals were ascribed, must be excluded altogether.
¶ Count Luigi Manzoni writes on the stained glass in Perugia in the
quattrocento, and in particular on the great window in S. Domenico,
which he ascribes in part to Fra Bartolommeo di Pietro Accomandati,
who appears to have worked in stained glass already in the fourteenth
century at a time when most Italian towns were forced to employ
foreigners for such work. The greater part of the window was executed,
according to the author, in the second half of the fifteenth century,
and by the painter Benedetto Bonfigli. ¶ In this number Dr. Friedländer
concludes his notices of the Bruges Exhibition. He deals with Albert
Cornelis, an artist who was first recognized by Mr. James Weale,
and with Jan Provost, with regard to whom he follows M. G. Hulin.
He agrees therefore in giving to the artist, Mr. Sutton-Nelthorpe’s
Legend of St. Francis. More surprising is his suggestion that the
Madonna, lent by Madame André under the name of Van Eyck, which was
reproduced in the April number of <span class="smcap">The Burlington Magazine</span>, is
a youthful work of Jan Provost. With regard to Jan van Eeckele, the
author maintains a sceptical attitude. He supposes the signature J.V.E.
attached to certain works to be forgeries intended for Jan Van Eyck.
After discussing the works of the later Flemish and Dutch artists, Dr.
Friedländer discourses on the works which are not of purely Flemish
origin. Among them the most interesting was the so-called Antonello
da Messina, lent by Baron d’Albenas, representing the Pietà. This,
following M. Hulin, Dr. Friedländer gives to a French artist, and dates
about 1470. The mixture of Italian and Flemish influence in this work
is, we think, of quite a different kind from that found in French works
of the period.</p>

<p class="p0 mtop2">R<span class="smaller">ASSEGNA
D</span>’A<span class="smaller">RTE</span>.—To the April number M. George le
Brun contributes an enthusiastic, though by no means exaggerated,
appreciation of the elder Breughel, ‘the only artist of his time who
knew how to withstand the enchantments of the Italian masters,’ though
he too travelled in Italy. Signor Enrico Cavilia calls attention to the
imposing ruins of the basilica at Squillace which he ascribes to about
the year 600. If this is accurate it becomes, after St. Abbondio at
Como, the earliest example of a basilica in the form of a Latin cross.
This important example of early Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span> architecture has been little
noticed hitherto. Signor Rivoira, for example, makes no mention of it.
¶ A small piece of stuff with a woven pattern of figures, rabbits,
birds, and ornamental <i>intreccie</i>, which was found at Modena in
1900, forms the subject of an article by Isabella Errera. This has
hitherto been supposed to be of Byzantine workmanship, but the author
by comparison with other pieces of similar design and workmanship
ascribes it to Arab workmen under Byzantine influence.</p>

<p>In the May number Signor Paoletti publishes an ancona (insufficiently
reproduced) by Jacobello Bonomo. This ancona in its original carved
frame is dated 1385, and is important as showing how early the
traditional form of the ancona as it appears in the works of the
Muranese school was fixed. This indeed differs but slightly from the
altarpieces of Antonio da Murano in Sta. Zaccharia at Venice, which
are dated nearly half a century later. ¶ Signor Ricci continues to
elucidate the little-known Giovanni Francesco da Rimini, an artist
of the Romagna influenced by Benedetto Bonfigli, and through him
deriving many motives which recall the work of Filippo Lippi. These are
specially noticeable in the Baptism belonging to Signor Blumenstihl
at Rome. The other picture, which he attributes to this mediocre but
agreeable painter, is a Madonna adoring the Infant Saviour which is No.
255 of the Bologna Gallery. ¶ Signor Augusto Bellini Pietri discourses
on the frescoes of S. Piero a Grado which were brought to light in
1885 at Cavalcaselle’s instigation. Cavalcaselle himself judged of
them as feeble productions of the early Pisan school which might be
connected with the name of Giunta Pisano. He failed to see traces of
true Byzantine influence. Signor Pietri’s view practically coincides
with this, except that he considers them of much greater artistic
significance and as indicating the dawn of the new Italian spirit, the
beginnings of a dramatic and expressive art as opposed to the hieratic
and purely architectonic character of the Byzantine. ¶ Signor Ricci
calls attention to an interesting portrait of Luca Pacioli acquired
by the Naples Gallery with a Cartellino bearing the inscription JACO.
BAR. VIGENNIS. 1495. If vigennis is a corruption of <i>ventenne</i>,
and if Jaco. Bar. stands for Jacopo de Barbari, it brings that artist’s
birth down to a much later period than has hitherto been assumed.
Unfortunately Signor Ricci does not indicate how far the painting in
question conforms to the manner of Jacopo de Barbari’s known works.
¶ Signor Ferrari announces the installation of the new museum at
Piacenza, and describes its two chief treasures, the Christ at the
Column by Antonello da Messina and the tondo (poorly reproduced), which
is ascribed, somewhat rashly we think, to Botticelli himself.</p>

<p class="p0 mtop2">O<span class="smaller">NZE</span> K<span class="smaller">UNST</span>
contains two articles by Max Rooses; in one he
describes the Pacully collection in Paris, which has recently come
into the market, and, <i>à propos</i> of the picture of a young woman
writing, by the Master of the half-figures, which was exhibited at
Bruges, makes a suggestion that possibly the half-figure pictures
were executed by Jan Matsys when he was absent from the Netherlands,
and may have come into connexion with Clouet’s school in France. The
colour scheme and scale of modelling of Jan Matsys’s signed Lucretia
is, we should have thought, quite distinct from that of the half-figure
pictures. ¶ In the second article the author makes known a Rubens
belonging to the Countess Constantin de Bousies. The picture is of
a satyr pressing grapes into a cup held by a young satyr; in the
foreground a tigress is suckling her young. M. Rooses declares this to
be the original of the similar picture at Dresden.</p>

<p class="p0 mtop2">A<span class="smaller">TENEUM</span>. H<span class="smaller">ELSINGFORS</span>.-No. 1 contains an article on mediaeval
art in Finland with illustrations of sculptures of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, which shows how closely the types of early French
and German Gothic sculptures were followed. The St. Margaret from Vemo
has almost the grace and ease of movement and the large disposition of
draperies of the best French work of the end of the thirteenth century.
The later work indicates more clearly German influence. Osvald Siren
publishes two Florentine Madonna reliefs, at present in Sweden. One is
a stucco copy of a relief by Desiderio, lately in the possession of
Mrs. Pepys Cockerell.</p>

<p class="p0 mtop2">T<span class="smaller">HE</span> R<span class="smaller">EVUE DE

Pacully collection, and the record by M. Paul Vitry of an interesting
discovery, an almost contemporary copy of a lost portrait of the Comte
de Dunois, the original probably being by Jean Fouquet.</p>

<p class="p0 mtop2">L’A<span class="smaller">RT</span>, for April, contains a number of reproductions of
mediaeval works by royal and titled amateurs, an article on the

a caricaturist, and one on the exhibition of the Société National des

illuminating remarks on mediaeval methods of work; not the least
interesting is the suggestion that when columns of Purbeck marble were
ordered from Corfe, the designs of mouldings and sections were left to
the Corfe masons.</p>

B<span class="smaller">ÜCHERFREUNDE</span>, April, 1903.—The first number
of the seventh annual volume of this periodical opens with a detailed
account by H. A. L. Degener of the John Rylands Library at Manchester.
The building is described and the history of its foundation related.
The biography of John Rylands himself is followed by an interesting
account of the founders of the Althorp collection, now incorporated,
through the munificence of Mrs. Rylands, with the other contents of
the palatial building at Manchester. The purchase of the Crawford
collection of MSS. by Mrs. Rylands is duly recorded, and a good summary
is given of the most important treasures of the library in the way
of block-books and incunabula, with special attention to the books
from early English presses. The article is illustrated with sketches
of the building and facsimiles of rare specimens of printing. An
article follows on the contemporary book-decorator, Hugo Hoppener,
whose pseudonym is Fidus. His work is unknown in this country, and
such specimens as are given do not inspire us with any desire for a
closer acquaintance with it. Modern printing in Russia is described
by P. Ettinger, and there is a review of two important facsimiles of
block-books recently published by Heitz, and edited by Professor W.
L. Schreiber, the ‘Twelve Sibyls,’ at St. Gallen, and the edition of
the ‘Biblia Pauperum,’ in fifty leaves, at Paris. A specimen of each

<h3 id="Professor_Langton_Douglas_and_Documentary_Evidence">PROFESSOR LANGTON
DOUGLAS AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE.</h3>

<p class="p0">S<span class="smaller">IR</span>,</p>

<p>Professor Douglas’s long and elaborate reply to my note is no doubt
interesting; but it seems as if he considers the subject of more vital
importance than I do; and I fancy most readers of <span class="smcap">The Burlington
Magazine</span> will agree with me so far. It is scarcely necessary to
point out the personal turn to which his arguments veer; but I am
unregenerate enough to draw attention to the fact that, in spite of
much circumlocution, he brings out <i>none</i> that really <i>prove</i>
me wrong in my contentions. I do not deny the talents of either Signor
Centofanti or Signor Donati (of the works of the former and the
friendship of the latter I have reason to speak most highly); but their
names alone scarcely carry conviction to the ordinary English reader.
I must repeat that I do <i>not</i> consider that Professor Douglas’s
<i>assertions</i> with regard to Sodoma will bear close examination.
The explanation of this in detail would take too long here; but I hope
some day to have an opportunity of going fully into the subject of that
artist’s name and family. That Beccafumi was <i>very frequently</i>
designated as ‘Mecharino,’ or ‘Mecarino,’ is beyond dispute, and the
statements here brought forward are certainly not sufficient to
account for the <i>entire</i> omission of this important fact from
Professor Douglas’s work. With regard to Matteo’s Massacre of the
Innocents, I can only suggest to anyone interested in the subject to
go and look at the picture, signature, and original document, and then
form his own opinion.</p>

<p>On both these points the reader cannot do better than compare the
statements here set forth with those in the ‘History of Siena.’ I
need say no more; but, in conclusion, I cannot resist remarking how
great was my astonishment to find that until last April Professor
Douglas, in spite of all his studies at Siena, was not aware that
the Archivio dei Contratti of that city (<i>Archivio Notarile
Provinciale</i>)—referred to continually by Milanesi and others,
and containing many important documents (including two wills of
Francesco Tolomei, in the second of which Matteo’s picture is not
mentioned)—is an <i>absolutely different</i> institution from its
younger, and admittedly more imposing and interesting, rival—the
Archivio di Stato, is under different control, and is even a cause of
jealousy. Surely, when preparing to overthrow the consensus of opinion
of a number of competent predecessors, it is scarcely safe to trust
implicitly to <i>copies</i>, and a search for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span> this original will would
have saved that situation anyhow. Had I not received this information
from the writer’s own lips, I could not have believed it possible.
For <i>the</i> historian of Siena to admit ignorance of the separate
existence and constitution of this important storehouse seems to me
to be more damaging to his reputation for accuracy than any points of
detail upon which differences of opinion can arise.</p>

<h3 id="The_Authorship_of_a_Madonna_by_Solario">THE AUTHORSHIP OF A MADONNA BY
SOLARIO</h3>

<p class="p0">S<span class="smaller">IR</span>,</p>

<p>The Madonna by Solario which you reproduce in your number for May is
a picture by no means unknown in art literature. It is reproduced on
Plate XXXVII of Rosini’s ‘Storia della Pittura Italiana,’ and as No.
29bis, IIS. in Muxell’s ‘Catalogue of the Leuchtenberg Collection,’
and such well-known critics as Waagen, Rumohr, Hettner, and Crowe and
Cavalcaselle have spoken of it. The last-named writers unhesitatingly
ascribe the picture in question to Andrea Solario of Milan, declaring
the signature a coarse forgery. Rosini, who seems to have known all
about the picture, says:—‘Could we trust this signature—Antonius da
Solario Venetus f—there would be no doubt regarding the home of this
artist. But are we bound to have a blind faith in a signature, when we
happen to know the history of the picture, and how it passed through
the hands of restorers and dealers before it was sold to the collection
where it now hangs? Experience has taught me to entertain very serious
doubts.’<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>I share these doubts, for I cannot hesitate a moment in ascribing this
very charming Madonna to Andrea Solario. Mr. Roger Fry in his admirable
note on this picture mentions the points of likeness which it has with
the Brera Madonna and Saints, dated 1495. There happens to be another
work even closer to this one, and in my opinion certainly by Solario,
although not attributed to him.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> It belongs to Dr. J. P. Richter,
and represents the Madonna adoring the Holy Child. So Venetian are its
colour, tone, and feeling, that more than one good critic has attempted
to find its author in Venice; but so singularly like are the ovals, so
identical the eyes and mouths of the Virgins in Dr. Richter’s and in
Mr. Wertheimer’s pictures, that they could not have been painted by
different hands. A Madonna belonging to Signor Crespi of Milan, never,
that I am aware, ascribed to another than Solario, although of later
date, again betrays identity of hand, in the landscape at least, with
Mr. Wertheimer’s painting.</p>

<p>But Mr. Fry, who, if any one, has a right to an opinion, admits
the possibility that the signature is genuine; in which case Mr.
Wertheimer’s picture would be by a painter famous in Neapolitan
art-mythology, who is supposed to have executed the frescoes in the
cloister of Sanseverino at Naples. Mr. Fry, with a candour by no
means common among recent writers on art, tells us that he is not
acquainted with these frescoes. I happen to know them well, and I can
assure Mr. Fry that these paintings and Mr. Wertheimer’s Madonna have
nothing in common. The latter, like all of Solario’s works, even the
most Venetian, displays many characteristics of an art substantially
Milanese, while the frescoes contain no element of the kind. The
principal author of the series (he freely employed assistants) seems
to have been a Sicilian educated under Antonello, Gentile Bellini,
and Carpaccio. In his wanderings up and down the peninsula his fancy
seems to have been taken by Pintoricchio’s landscape—a taste for which
Carpaccio’s romantic scenery had doubtless prepared him. No other
influences are visible in his work, neither Lombard, nor Ferrarese, nor
Florentine. I am amazed that paintings so obviously Venetian should
have remained so long unrecognized for what they are.</p>

<p>I would gladly say more of the author of these frescoes (there is not
a little to be said), but I must now hasten to answer the question
that may be asked: But what if the inscription is ancient? Even then
Mr. Wertheimer’s picture does not cease to be Andrea Solario. The
inscription may in fact never have been intended for a signature,
but for a label. Soon after it was painted this picture may have
fallen into the hands of a person who, like so many of us to-day when
addressing a letter, confused the Christian name of the painter with
one resembling it, and, wishing to make sure that he did not forget it
altogether, had it inscribed according to his inaccurate recollection
upon the panel, with the addition of the fact that the picture was
painted in Venice—for that is all that the word <i>Venetus</i> need
mean here. Or if it does mean more, this more would tend to establish
the value of connoisseurship. It was on internal evidence alone that
I came to the conclusion, published in my ‘Lorenzo Lotto’ some nine
years ago, that Solario must have made a long enough sojourn at Venice
to have become deeply imbued with the ideas of Alvise Vivarini: and
now Mr. Wertheimer’s picture, if the inscription be ancient, would
confirm this hypothesis to the extent of proving that Solario remained
long enough in Venice to be considered a Venetian, just as Lotto, for
instance, owing to a residence of two or three years at Treviso, was
called a Trevisan.</p>

summer, by the courtesy of Sir Hubert Parry, I was enabled to
visit Highnam Court in company with Mr. Berenson. It was intended that
we should collaborate in the work of bringing to the notice of students
some of the very remarkable Italian paintings in this collection. Owing
to ill health and the pressure of other work Mr. Berenson has not
been able to do what he had hoped. Under these circumstances I shall
confine myself to a brief account of these pictures in the hope that
at some future date Mr. Berenson will again take the subject in hand
and draw from these examples those more definite conclusions which his
far wider knowledge of Italian art would justify. In justice to him I
must add that, except where expressly stated, he is not responsible
for the ideas here put forward. ¶ A few words on the collection in
general may be appropriate; for, no less than the house, the garden,
and all its surroundings, the collection at Highnam bears the impress
of a very remarkable personality, that of Thomas Gambier Parry, the
father of the present owner. On leaving the university, in 1838, Parry
bought the Highnam estate, near Gloucester, which became thenceforward
his home. But the duties of a country squire, though undertaken with
unusual energy and benevolence, did not absorb his entire activities.
His enthusiastic love of Italian art led him to travel frequently, and
to devote himself to the hope of acclimatizing in England the art of
fresco wall-decoration. Realizing the unsuitability to our climate of
the true Italian method of fresco painting, he made many researches
in technique, which led to the discovery of the method of spirit
fresco, which is best known in England from Sir Frederick Leighton’s
two examples in the Victoria and Albert Museum. But Parry was not only
an inventor; he himself practised the art with considerable success.
The church which he built in his park for the village of Highnam is
decorated internally by him; the paintings of St. Andrew’s chapel in
Gloucester cathedral, and of the roof of Tewkesbury abbey, are also due
to him. But perhaps the best known is his decoration of the wooden roof
of the nave in Ely cathedral, which must certainly be counted as one
of the few really successful modern attempts to recapture the spirit
of mediaeval decorative design. All these works were executed by him
without payment, and largely at his own expense. ¶ We are, however,
not concerned here with Parry as an artist, but as a connoisseur, and
the collection at Highnam shows that in this he was as original, as
independent of the fashions of his day, and of as fine a taste as in
his other capacities. For, at the time when the Highnam collection was
made it was not yet a title to social distinction to have one’s walls
decorated with Italian primitives. The works of the trecento are not
even now estimated at their real value, and it is in the specimens of
trecento and early quattrocento painting that the Highnam collection
is most remarkable. ¶ Hence, if we take the works in chronological
order, we begin at once with a picture which is in its way unique, the
Nativity and Adoration (<a href="#i_119">Plate I</a>). The singularity of this is that we
have here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span> a panel painted in tempera, belonging at the latest to the
early years of the fourteenth century, which is not only untouched,
but in complete preservation, and which for brilliance and intensity
of colour and the perfection of its enamel-like smalto can scarcely
be surpassed by works of the succeeding century. It is a small panel
in which the figures are drawn with miniature-like precision. The
prevailing tone is the pale brown in which the rocky landscape is
rendered. It is almost of the colour and surface quality of boxwood or
tarnished ivory. Upon this the plants and trees, still treated with
the elementary symbolism of Byzantine art, are relieved in vivid black
green; while the chief notes in the draperies—which are hatched with
gold, according to the Byzantine tradition—are an intense blue green
and a very positive transparent pink, with rarer touches of scarlet
and celadon green. The effect of this colour scheme is very unusual,
and recalls at once the well-known altarpiece of St. Cecilia in the
corridor of the Uffizi. Two other altarpieces, by the same master, who
is best known from his frescoes in the upper church at Assisi, have
been recently discovered by Mr. Herbert Horne in the neighbourhood of
Florence, and in these also a similar colour scheme is observable.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
That the Highnam panel is a contemporary work, and, like those, marks
the first germs of a distinctively Italian tradition, is apparent,
but the tempting conclusion that it is by the same remarkable painter
is not altogether borne out by the forms. For the master of the St.
Cecilia altarpiece, though he was Giotto’s contemporary, shows an
independent development out of the older tradition. Only in the Assisi
frescoes is he influenced, and that in a secondary and superficial
way, by Giotto; whereas this panel, which from its composition and
the use of gold hatchings on the draperies we may assign to an early
period of the movement, bears already decided traces of the style of
Giotto. ¶ Whereas in the master of the St. Cecilia altarpiece we note
the peculiarity of small heads, elongated figures, fine-drawn features,
and spider-like extremities; above all a sense of elegance, almost of
affectation, which connects his work more with the decadent classic
tradition than with the new ideas of Giovanni Pisano and Giotto; here
we have already, more rounded forms, and more solid relief, while
the poses are of a kind which allow of re-entering lines, gathering
the form together in a self-centred mass. Particularly noteworthy in
this respect is the group at the bottom of the composition, where
the influence of forms discovered by Giovanni Pisano in bas-relief
is clearly apparent. ¶ There are comparatively few extant works of
art which exemplify this precise movement in the development of the
Italian from the early Christian style, but among them the closest
analogy to our picture may be found in the panels at Munich, Nos. 979
and 980, in which a number of scenes are united in a single panel,
though not as here in a single composition. We have in them a similar
mixture of Byzantine tradition as seen in the gold hatchings on the
draperies, similar large and rather heavy masks, similar deep shadows
in the eye orbits, while the corners of the mouth are marked by similar
round dots. Indeed the angel to Christ’s left in the Last judgement
of the Munich panels is almost the exact counterpart of the angel
immediately above the Christ in the Highnam Adoration. These Munich
panels are considered by Mr. Berenson to be early works by Giotto. Is
it possible that we have in the Highnam picture yet another early work
by the same hand, and in incomparably better preservation? Besides the
general likeness of style to the Munich pictures, there are certain
characteristics which would point to such a conclusion; perhaps the
most striking is the drawing of the hands. Thus the pose of the
Madonna’s hand with the two first fingers outstretched, the others
clenched, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
a peculiarity constant in Giotto. Another characteristic trait is
the tendency to bring the fingers of the opened hand to a point, as
in the right hand of the third king.</p>

<p>On the other hand we must
point out that the Munich pictures, in spite of the roughness of
their execution, indicate a richer imagination, a greater energy of
dramatic presentment, than can be claimed for the Highnam piece.
There is nothing in the latter which can compare, for instance, with
the inexpressible tenderness with which the Virgin contemplates the
Child in the Munich picture. In our picture, the attempt to infuse
life into the older formula is evident, but the persons of the drama
still remain somewhat coldly self-absorbed and aloof; that flash of
mutual interaction and sympathy which both Giovanni Pisano and Giotto
realized so intensely is still lacking. ¶ In the present state of our
knowledge, which leaves open so many unsuspected possibilities, it is,
perhaps, unsafe to go further; but at least this can be said, that we
have here no Giottesque work in the ordinary sense of the word, which
might be more appropriately termed Gaddesque, but a work executed
either by Giotto himself, or more probably by some contemporaneous
artist who was elaborating at the same time with him the new idea;
or if by a pupil, one who came under his influence at a very early
date, before Giotto’s own style was fully matured. Certainly this work
has none of the academic qualities of the followers who, like Taddeo
Gaddi, accepted the formulæ of Giotto’s later style; it has in it,
like Giotto’s own work, the spring and vitality which come with the
germination of a new and fruitful conception. And among the works of
this fascinating period of Italian painting, we know of none which
surpass this in the polished perfection of the technique nor in the
marvellous preservation of its surface. ¶ The next important picture
(<a href="#i_121">Plate II</a>), keeping to the chronological order, is one of the most
magnificent of the many noble altarpieces which have come down to us
from the fourteenth century. Even in Florence itself it would be
hard to find an altarpiece in which the religious sentiment of the
time is expressed in more imposing forms, or in which the decoration
is more sumptuous and the execution more refined. It is, moreover, in
wonderful preservation, and the pale flat tints of pure heliotrope,
dull scarlet and blue, and white flushed with pink, relieved upon a
background of elaborately stamped gold, produce an effect of brilliance
and variety toned to a perfect harmony which the artists of Florence
rarely surpassed. Indeed, in the pallor and brilliance of the colour
scheme, as also in the atmospheric tonality and the absence of vigorous
relief in the figures, we are reminded of Sienese art. The forms,
however, are essentially Florentine. The inscription at the base leaves
us in no doubt about the author of this masterpiece; it runs: <span class="smaller">ANNO
DNI MCCCXLVIII BERNARDVS PINXIT ME QUEM FLORENTIE</span> (<i>sic</i>)
<span class="smaller">FINSIT</span>. The original notion that this Bernardo was the same
as Nardo the elder brother of Orcagna has been exposed by Milanesi, to
whose researches we owe all that is known of Bernardo da Firenze or
Bernardo Daddi, whose <i>chef d’œuvre</i> is the Highnam altarpiece.
Bernardo Daddi was almost overlooked by Vasari, who makes him, by an
anachronism of more than half a century, a pupil of Spinello Aretino;
nor did Crowe and Cavalcaselle realize his importance in their ‘History
of Painting.’ Milanesi has, however, discovered many facts about Daddi,
who, though inferior in the vitality and freshness of his imagination
to Giottino, was perhaps a finer artist than any other of the immediate
successors of Giotto. Certainly Taddeo Gaddi, who somehow came to be
regarded as the <i>capo scuola</i>, has left nothing comparable to this
as regards the variety and self-consistency of the types, the nobility
of the design and spacing of the figures, or the research for beauty in
the execution. Even in the Crucifixion, though it is only a variation
of Giotto’s inventions, there survives, in spite of a tendency to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
more sentimental treatment, something of the great master’s dramatic
feeling. There is much here, moreover, that seems already to suggest
Orcagna, and Daddi may perhaps be regarded as the connecting link
between him and Giotto. ¶ What is known of the life of Daddi may be
found at length in Milanesi’s commentary to Vasari’s life of Stefano
Fiorentino and Ugolino Sanese. Milanesi champions eloquently the cause
of this great but curiously neglected artist—that his pleading has
not been altogether successful may be due in part to the fact that
he endeavours to establish Daddi’s authorship of the frescoes of the
Triumph of Death, in the <i>camposanto</i> at Pisa. The improbability
of such a view will be apparent to anyone who compares them with the
Highnam altarpiece. Daddi, who was born at the close of the thirteenth
century, died either in 1348 according to Crowe and Cavalcaselle, or
in 1350 according to Milanesi. This picture must therefore be one of
his latest, as it is also one of his finest works. It came originally
from the church of St. George at Ruballa, whence it passed into the
Bromley collection. It is referred to as being in that collection
by Crowe and Cavalcaselle, and is mentioned as being in England by
Milanesi. ¶ To a considerably later period of the fourteenth century
belongs the Coronation of the Virgin (<a href="#i_123a">Plate III</a>), which is ascribed
in the catalogue to Giotto. It is, however, clearly a fine work by
the last great Giottesque master of Florence, Agnolo Gaddi, whose
characteristic qualities and defects are here admirably displayed. The
weak lines of the boneless fingers with their rounded ends, the long
thin noses imperfectly articulated with the mask, and the want of life
and character in the figures, betray the facile exponent of a stock
formula which made but small demands upon the artist’s observation or
his feeling for reality. It was, indeed, due to the cleverness and,
if we are to believe Vasari, the commercial astuteness of the Gaddi
family that Giotto’s style was crystallized into so lifeless a system
of design. But Agnolo, though he inherited too much from his father,
was more of an artist. Where, as at Sta. Croce, he depicts a stirring
narrative, his line, at other times mechanical and slow, becomes alert
and expressive of at least the more obvious dramatic effects, while at
all times he shows a refined taste and originality as a decorator in
the more limited sense of the word. Judged as an imaginative rendering
of a supreme event, this picture is certainly cold and inadequate,
but as a piece of elaborate decoration it is charmingly designed
and brilliantly executed. The brocade hanging, which reminds one of
Orcagna’s school, is painted with the utmost skill; on a ground of
brilliant orange red, the symmetrical pattern of birds and flowers is
relieved in intensest blue and gold. The draperies and flesh are for
the most part in that beautiful pale key which Agnolo affected; the
opposition of pale grey, blue, and saffron yellow, with stronger notes
of mauve and pink, forms one of those complex and sumptuous harmonies
of colour which were unfortunately abandoned by the artists of the
succeeding century. The general likeness of this to Taddeo Gaddi’s
version of the same subject in the sacristy of Sta. Croce (<a href="#i_123b">Plate III</a>)
(there attributed to Giotto) is apparent. Agnolo has even repeated,
though in a modified form, the peculiar double sleeve which is not
unfrequent in Taddeo’s pictures. The influence of Orcagna is, however,
to be seen in the more rectilinear folds and the attempt at structural
design in the draperies.</p>

  <div class="caption">TRIPTYCH, BY THE SAME PAINTER; IN THE UFFIZI, FLORENCE</div>

<p>We come next to an artist who was probably
at one time Agnolo Gaddi’s pupil. The two little predella pieces
representing the Visitation and the Adoration of the Magi (<a href="#i_127a">Plate IV</a>)
are not only among the most charming pieces of the collection, but they
are among the best works of an artist whose sense of beauty was almost
of the highest order—Lorenzo Monaco. The melodious rhythm of his
long-drawn interlacing lines, the sweetness and lucidity of his design,
are here beautifully apparent. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
peculiar treatment of drapery would seem to indicate that the miniature
paintings of northern Europe, particularly of French workmanship, were
not without their influence on him. But here, though the main ideas of
design are essentially gothic, there is much that already foreshadows
the art of the fifteenth century. How much of Fra Angelico there
already is in the tenderly expressive gesture of the Virgin’s hands
as she raises St. Elizabeth from her knees, while the movement of the
right leg and the peculiar disposition of the drapery which it causes
are favourite motives with the pupil. Angelico, indeed, had but little
to add to this exquisite interpretation of the subject. How much,
too, of Fra Filippo Lippi’s genre feeling is already hinted at in the
figure leaning against the doorpost—how much of his romance in the
woodland background! Lorenzo Monaco’s importance as the inspirer of the
new ideas of the quattrocento perhaps deserves more recognition. The
Adoration is a variation upon the theme of a predella piece by Lorenzo
in the Raczynski gallery at Berlin; but the differences between this,
which we must assume to be a late work, and the Berlin picture are
remarkable. The head of the second king in particular is so different
from Lorenzo’s usual type, so near to what Masolino or the young
Masaccio might have done, that one wonders whether some pupil, already
advancing beyond his master in the new direction, may not have had a
hand in it. ¶ If these works by Lorenzo Monaco show the emergence from
the gothic formula of a new spirit, our next picture (<a href="#i_129a">Plate V</a>) is on
the contrary a curious case of retardation. ¶ The general effect of
this picture is decidedly Giottesque; the colour scheme is still of
the gay and variegated kind that occurs in works of the trecento.
The crimson robes with yellow high lights, the indigo blues and apple
greens, all belong to the Giottesque tradition; but, none the less,
this picture was probably executed at a period when the more original
artists had already established the new ideas of fifteenth-century art.
The master who executed this was clearly a reactionary who clung to the
old, convenient receipts for the fabrication of handsomely decorated
altarpieces. His works are not uncommon in and around Florence, and
may be easily recognized by the peculiar alert expression of the eyes
and the gaiety and piquancy of his faces. One of his pictures in the
corridor of the Uffizi is reproduced here (<a href="#i_129b">Plate V</a>); another is in
Fiesole cathedral. The artist shows some evidence of the influence
of Lorenzo Monaco, though this is more apparent in the draperies of
the Uffizi picture than in the Highnam Madonna. The latter seems
in essentials to be rather a continuation of the purely Florentine
Giottesque tradition of the end of the fourteenth century, and is
probably a somewhat earlier work. ¶ Whoever our artist may be, his
work scarcely rises above the level of tasteful and accomplished
craftsmanship, and his chief interest is as an example of one phase of
the work of the period of transition to the style of the quattrocento.
One is apt to forget that long after Masaccio and Castagno had
realized in paint the new plastic ideas of Donatello, the older firms
of ecclesiastical furnishers went on contentedly in the earlier
manner, which was, in fact, better adapted to the requirements of the
altarpiece. Even in the next generation Neri di Bicci only made a
sufficient pretence to structural draughtsmanship and modelling to pass
muster among his contemporaries.</p>

exhibition of Mussulman art held during the months of May and June
in the Pavillon de Marsan at Paris afforded an opportunity such as is
rarely given of studying the art of the Mussulman nations. The objects
brought together included some fine examples of their various classes,
and most of them, coming as they did from private collections, had not
before been seen by the public. ¶ The art of miniature-painting is one
of those in which the Mussulmans have excelled, especially the Persians
and the Turks, who, since the appearance upon the world’s scene of the
hordes of Jenghis Khan, have lived by Iranian culture and civilization.
Also it is one of the least known, for we have to go in search of
specimens of this art to the manuscripts in which they are scattered
without order and, at least at first sight, without logic. Moreover, as
will presently be seen, only a very restricted few of these paintings
are signed and dated, so that it is only by external considerations
that we can succeed in identifying a period and a country of origin. ¶
The Mussulman religion has always been shy of encouraging the art of
painting; in fact, the tradition of Islam formally forbids it. This
absolute prohibition was borrowed by Mohammed from the Jews, and he
also reckoned upon establishing a distinction between his Faithful,
of whom he wished to make a nation of iconoclasts, and the Byzantine
Christians and Mazdean Persians, who decorated their palaces with
carvings and their books with paintings. He who draws a human figure,
or even a representation of any kind of animal, says the Sunna, shall
give it his soul at the Day of Judgement, and thus perish amid the
torments of hell. Fortunately for the history of art, the Mussulmans
did not observe this prohibition more strictly than did Solomon that
of the Bible, when he introduced figures of animals into the Temple;
but it did not fail to weigh heavily upon the artistic development of
a whole world, and it forced the latter to confine itself vaguely to
geometrical decoration, while systematically renouncing statuary and
figured representations, which enabled Greek art to attain its full
splendour. ¶ Passing through the galleries of the Pavillon de Marsan,
one was struck by the smallness of the space occupied by figured
representations among the number of objects there brought together.
Here and there, at very rare intervals, one found a few bronzes
representing animals; while as for the carpets, the accoutrements,
the copper vessels, the glass lamps, it was only exceptionally that
they bore anything but inscriptions in large <i>neskhi</i> letters,
taken from verses of the Koran or from the traditions attributed to
the prophet Mohammed. Nor did any but a certain number of Persian
manuscripts contain other than those commonplace decorations which we
find throughout the Islam world, from the Hispano-Arab monuments of
Seville and Granada to the mosques raised by the descendants of Timur
Bey in the countries that form the frontier of Chinese Turkestan.
¶ The impression of a person seeing once, and a little quickly, an
exhibition, however limited, of Mussulman paintings, is that all these
miniatures are so many isolated artistic fancies, scarcely connected
one with the other, and that the painters who have executed them have
confined themselves to following the whims of their imagination,
without troubling to know what had been done before them, or to inquire into the workmanship
of artists contemporary with themselves.</p>

</div>

<p>This is an inevitable
impression, but a radically false one, as a careful and prolonged
examination of the documents easily enables us to see. ¶
On the contrary, the world of Islam produced schools of which each had its
own methods and types. By comparing manuscripts of the same date
and origin, one perceives that, without exception, they present the
same pictures, and that, moreover, those pictures are very nearly
identical. They offer hardly the smallest variations in detail, while
in workmanship and in the general plan of the composition they are
strictly alike. It is thus that, in all the ‘Books of the Kings’
illustrated in Persia during the time of the Sefevæan kings, we find
the same scenes treated in identical fashion, with more or less
finish, according to the price of the book; in the same way, all the
manuscripts of the life of the famous Sufis of Sultan Husein Mirza
contain identical paintings, which are hardly differentiated one from
the other and which are evidently replicas of a common original,
drawn and painted by an artist of talent, the head of a school. ¶
No illuminated Arab manuscript is known of an earlier date than the
thirteenth century, and the reason of this is simple. So long as
the caliphate of Bagdad was sufficiently powerful, or, at least,
preserved sufficient moral authority, to cause the Mussulman law
to be respected in its integrity, none dared to violate one of the
strictest injunctions of the Sunna. The artists, both in the Persian
world and among the Mussulmans of Syria and Egypt, waited for the
day of the final decadence of the spiritual power before venturing
to transgress the formal prohibition against the reproduction, by
any process whatever, of the human figure, or even of animal forms.
¶ Arab books adorned with pictures (of indifferent merit) appeared
first in the empire of the Aiyubite sultans descended from Saladin.
This innovation raised a storm among the ulemas and men of law, who
looked upon it as an abomination; but the Aiyubite sovereigns, although
loudly proclaiming themselves the stoutest defenders of the Caliph of
Bagdad, were but little interested to know whether a thing was orthodox
or not. Had not Saladin built in the very heart of Cairo a college
for the Bathenians, whose doctrines, a hundred times anathematized
by the Abbasside caliphs, tended to prove that there existed neither
Allah nor Mohammed, and that the only possible divinity was the prime
mover, the first hypostasis, the absolute One of the Neoplatonists?
The Aiyubites troubled themselves so little about the prohibition
against reproducing the human figure that they had coins struck in
Syria bearing on the obverse the head of the Byzantine Christ and
on the reverse the usual inscriptions in the Arab tongue. Saladin
even went so far—and this is the acme of heterodoxy—as to plan a
marriage between his brother Melik Adel and the sister of Richard
Cœur-de-Lion, King of England. The Mussulman artists would have been
very wrong not to have taken it at their ease under the reign of such
liberal princes; and therefore, beginning with the extreme end of the
twelfth century, we behold the first appearance of illuminated Arab
manuscripts. ¶ These Arab manuscripts adorned with paintings are of
the greatest rarity, and are not generally distinguished for their
execution. They are curious documents, worthy of preservation because
of their rarity, rather than real works of art, and the painters who
illuminated them were never very careful with their work. They betrayed
an almost complete lack of imagination and invention, and confined
themselves to copying as best they could the illuminated pictures
in the manuscripts at their disposal, that is to say the Byzantine
manuscripts, in Egypt and Syria: as for the Mussulmans of the Maghreb
and the Yemen, it never occurred to their minds that it was possible
to adorn a book with pictures. The greater number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span> of the pictures in
Arab manuscripts are copied from Byzantine manuscripts of the eighth
to the eleventh century, and the limners, not knowing what they were
copying, often surrounded the heads of their figures with the golden
haloes of the saints of the Greek Church. ¶ There are only very few
Arab manuscripts the pictures of which rise above the conventional
commonplace level, although they always display very evident traces
of Byzantine influence. The most important of these manuscripts is a
copy of the <i>Makāmāt</i> (‘assemblies,’ or <i>séances</i>) of Harīrī,
which belongs to M. Charles Schefer. A very curious painting from
this manuscript, which was copied in Mesopotamia in the year 1237, is
reproduced in the present article. It shows a troop of horsemen in the
army of the Abbasside caliph, carrying the black silk standard of the
Abbas family and sounding enormous trumpets. This picture, which is
far from possessing the merit of the miniatures that adorn the Persian
manuscripts, presents to us, in a life-like manner, a scene which must
have been frequent in the streets of Bagdad and Damascus; the costumes
and the harness of the horses are absolutely correct and correspond in
every respect with the descriptions of apparel to be found at random
in the Arab historians. One fact which goes to show that Arab art, at
least in Syria, assumed a considerable development at that time is that
we possess two other manuscripts of these <i>séances</i> of Harīrī less
fine than the one in question, but illuminated by artists who evidently
belong to the same school. ¶ These painters of the Aiyubite period
considered that Byzantine art, itself very limited and restricted
almost exclusively to religious painting, did not offer a large enough
variety of models, and they looked around them for others. These were
so rare that our artists were sometimes content to reproduce Egyptian
stelæ, or to draw their inspiration from the statues of Pharaohs or
divinities which they encountered at every step on Egyptian soil,
copying to the best of their ability the hieroglyphic characters which
they found on those monuments and of which they understood not a word.
In short, painting never existed on Arab manuscripts save by way of
exception and in a sporadic state; and yet the Arab artists suffered
from no lack of subjects for illustration. What an inexhaustible
mine the ‘Thousand Nights and a Night’ would have supplied, and the
heroic romances of ‘Antarah, of Sultan Zahir Bibars, or the ‘History
of the Heroes of Islamism’ (<i>Siret el-mujāhidin</i>)! A few Arab
manuscripts copied in Persia are adorned with paintings, generally of
indifferent merit, but it is very evident that these do not belong
to Arab art properly so called, and that they must be included among
the productions of Iranian art. ¶ The only ornamentation of the Arab
manuscripts consists of the illumination of the titles and the first
pages of the text. They are not so fine as those done in Persia,
although we find copies of the Koran, written on parchment, richly
illuminated with gilded designs. But this ornamentation, reduced to
a very small number of colours and with broken lines, is heavy and
overladen with gildings: the Persians were more sober and showed that
they had less taste for tinsel.</p>

<p>The artistic history of Persia begins
with the Achæmenian kings, that is to say in the fifth century before
Christ, a very recent date compared with the antiquity of the ancient
Assyrian and Chaldean empires. Like all the countries of Hither Asia,
the Persia of the Achæmenians was tributary to the Babylonian Empire,
and the monuments of Persepolis and Murghab are obviously copied from
those of the valley of the Euphrates, while showing signs of a strong
Hellenic influence. In fact, the influence of Greece in Persia began
long before the conquest by Alexander, and the subjects of the Great
Kings had happily lightened the heavy architecture and ponderous
sculpture of Babylon by taking their inspiration from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
the methods of the artists of Hellas. It is thus that the Apadana of
Persepolis, the Apadana of Esther and Xerxes, is a compromise between
the oldest works of Assyrian art and the most grandiose specimens of
Greek architecture, between the Palace of Sargon, which it suggests
by the elevation of its immense walls and its heavy friezes, and the
Parthenon, in which we find the colonnade of the Persian edifice,
which the architecture of the Euphrates valley always ignored. The
casings in many-coloured bricks which adorn the Apadana were borrowed
by the Persians from Chaldean, or rather Assyrian art; and the frieze
of the Archers has its prototype in the glazed-brick low-reliefs of
the Dur-Sarkayan. The workmanship of those polychromatic casings has
changed very little in the course of the ages, and the methods employed
by the brick-makers who, in the sixteenth century, adorned the splendid
mosques of the Sefevæan kings at Ardabil and Veramin with sky-blue and
pale-green mosaics were almost identical with those of the artists of
the time of Sargon and Nebuchadnezzar. ¶ The Greek influence attained
its height in Iran after the conquest by Alexander, under the reign of
the Arsacidan princes who assumed the title of Philhellenes on their
coinage. The Sāsānians, while endeavouring to bring about a reaction
against that influence which had several times threatened to deprive
Iran of all its autonomy, were unable, at least at the commencement
of their dynasty, to dispense with the aid of the Greek artists, and
the inscriptions of the early kings of that dynasty are accompanied
by a Greek translation. ¶ The art and methods of construction of the
period of the Sāsānian kings were perpetuated long after the Mussulman
conquest; and the ogival doorways of the Timurid mosques of Samarcand
or of the mosques of the Sefevæan shahs recall, although with a much
less imposing aspect, the gigantic ogive, the <i>Ivān</i>, to-day
half-ruined, of the Palace of the Sāsānians at Ctesiphon, which,
according to the Islam tradition, was rent in two during the night in
which Mohammed came into the world. The Mussulman architects who built
the powerful citadels which stayed the onrush of the crusaders in Syria
also derived their inspiration from the Sāsānian tradition, and it
was thus that the gothic style made its way into the art of the east
and ended by supplanting the Roman style. ¶ If the influence of Greek
art was considerable in Ancient Persia, it was null in Persian art
according to Islam; for there was scarcely any point of contact between
the Byzantine world in its decline and Persia subjugated by the arms of
the caliphs and separated from the west by Syria and the provinces that
formed the Seljukian empire of Asia Minor. Nevertheless there exist a
few rare specimens of Persian painting of the end of the thirteenth
century which recall in a positive fashion the methods of Hellenic art;
but there is no doubt that the works which they serve to illustrate are
merely translations of Arab originals written in Syria and containing
miniatures imitated from Byzantine types. The Persian limners confined
themselves to reproducing those paintings at the same time that the
Arab works were being translated into the Persian language, and we
must beware of seeing in this the trace of any post-Islamic influence
of Byzantine art. ¶ The three great schools of painting in Persia
succeed one another without interruption and, encroaching one on the
other from the beginning of the thirteenth century to the early years
of the eighteenth century, correspond with the three great dominations
which held sway over Iran during this period of nearly five centuries:
the Mongolians, the Timurids and the Sefevæans. Books adorned with
paintings, in fact, make their first appearance with the dynasty of
the Mongolian sovereigns, whose ancestor, Hulagu, was sent to conquer
Persia by the Emperor of China, Manchu. Although the dynasties which
had made themselves independent in Persia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span> up to the Seljukians, had
taken matters easily with the Abbasside caliphate, it is no less true
that they were deeply attached to Islamism and that men hesitated under
their dominion openly to transgress the prescription of the religious
law. The Mongolian sovereigns, at least the first, did not profess
Islamism and even greatly preferred Christianity to the Mussulman
religion, although not themselves Christians. Some of them, such as
Hulagu, had Christian wives, and they often protected the Christians to
the detriment of the votaries of Mohammed. We know from the narrative
of the missionaries who were sent on embassy to the court of the
Grand Khan of Cathay—Jean du Plan de Carpin, Guillaume de Ruysbroeck
and others—that the Mongols made very coarse representations of
their divinity Itoga and of other spirits of an inferior order. Like
all the primitives, they greatly loved to see themselves pictured
in paintings, and the manuscripts which date from the time of the
Mongolian sovereigns of Persia are filled with portraits of the Khans,
different nobles accompanied by their wives and engaged in drinking
fermented mare’s milk in cups of Chinese porcelain. The Mongols, when
they issued from their steppes bent upon the conquest of the world,
were certainly the most ignorant people conceivable, for which reason
they were surrounded by Chinese secretaries, interpreters, engineers
and bureaucrats, without whom they would have been helpless. All this
yellow flood swept down upon Persia and there settled as in a conquered
country, introducing numbers of Turkish words into the language and,
into art, not the formulas of the Turks and Mongols, because these had
none, but those of the Celestial empire. It is certain that the Chinese
artists whom the Mongols had brought with them to Persia understood the
technicalities of painting infinitely better than did the Iranians,
even as the Chinese accountants could easily have given lessons to
all the financial clerks of the Sāmānids or Seljukians. And so the
Persian painters sat at the feet of the Chinese and eventually came
to create an art which was very different from that of the Celestial
empire, but which nevertheless displays many characteristics of Chinese
painting. In any case, it is certain that the miniatures which adorn
the Persian manuscripts from the time of the Mongols have no connexion
whatever with what is known to us of the art of the Sāsānidans, or with
the descriptions given by Mas‘ūdī of pictures which he had seen at
Persepolis in a book and by the unknown author of a chronicle entitled
the ‘Sum of Histories.’ ¶ The manuscripts illuminated in Persia and
in the regions that depended upon her during the Mongolian period
(1258–1335) are very numerous and all present the same characteristics:
the artists who illuminated them drew, above all, battle-scenes, sieges
of fortresses, bloody contests, or else banquets, for the Mongols
were, according to the account of travellers, great quaffers of strong
liquors. These pictures, however, are rarely so well executed as those
which belong to the school of the Timurids and the Sefevæans: the
Mongols were people who were not hard to please; they wished before
all things to be served quickly; and with them quantity easily took
the place of quality. It may be remarked that the manuscripts executed
at that time contain a very considerable number of paintings; but,
though these paintings possess a great documentary interest, they have
but a feeble interest from the artistic point of view. Some of them
are merely wash-drawings in uniform tints rather than paintings in the
proper sense of the word.</p>

<p>The schools of painting of the Mongolian
period did not last long in Persia, and it would seem as though, from
the moment when the descendants of Hulagu became converted to Islamism,
people in Persia began to look with an evil eye upon picture-books and
those who painted them. Moreover, the Mongolian dynasty gave way amid
so great a chaos and such infinite disorder that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
the Persians had too many other things to occupy their minds to
allow them to think of illustrating their ‘Books of the Kings’ or
the <i>Gulistān</i> of the Sheikh Sa‘dī. We still find in the great
European libraries a few manuscripts illuminated for the Djelairids
or the Mozafferids; but the political instability of Iran was at
that time so great that two copies of the same work are sometimes
dedicated to two successive sovereigns. ¶ The accession of Timur Bey
put an end to this anarchy, which, for that matter, was to begin
again a century later, and the reign of his successor, Shah-Rokh,
was a period of peace such as Persia had not known since long. Under
the reign of this pacific prince, who waged no war until driven to
extremes by his kinsmen, there was executed, at Herat, one of the
most splendid specimens of Iranian painting, the manuscript of the
‘Ascension of Mohammed to Heaven.’ Illuminated books belonging to the
Timurid school of Persia and Turkestan are not excessively rare, and
we must look among them to find the master-pieces of Persian painting.
A certain number of these volumes come from the libraries of the
Timurids, principally from that of Herat, where Sultan Husain Mirza had
collected a magnificent library, which has now completely disappeared.
¶ These Timurid sovereigns, including those who reigned in the east
of Persia and in Transoxiana after the death of Tamerlane (Timur Bey)
as well as those who went to seek their fortune in Hindustan, were
great lovers of works of art and of fine literature. At Samarcand,
they raised the splendid mosques, now ruined, which were the ornament
of the Righistan—the Tilla-kari, Bibi-khanum and Guri-Mir—whose
gutted cupolas, all enamelled with many-coloured bricks, still excite
the admiration of archæologists. Timur Bey, whom the pamphlet of
Ibn-Arabshah did not a little to represent as a vulgar toper, delighted
in reading the <i>Ghazels</i> of Hāfiz and the ‘Romance of Alexander’
of Nizāmī. Some of his writings are master-pieces of Turco-Oriental
literature, and the unauthenticity of his Memoirs has never been
absolutely proved. His grandson, Ulugh Beg, was the Alfonso X of the
east, and the astronomical tables which he drew up with the aid of the
most celebrated cosmographers form one of the most important works of
Oriental mathematics. Sultan Husain ibn Baïkara lived in his capital
of Herat surrounded by the most famous writers of his time—‘Alī Shīr
his Vizir, the illustrious Sūfī Jāmī, Khwānd-Amīr the historian—and
his collection of biographies of Mussulman saints is one of the
master-pieces of elegant prose produced by Persian literature. ¶ The
Emperor Babar, who, when the Timurid empire was definitely ruined in
Persia, went away to conquer Hindustan, has left a sober and severe
history of his long campaigns which recalls Caesar’s ‘Commentaries.’
In the midst of their intrigues and of the crimes which they did not
hesitate to commit to obtain possession of the throne, his descendants,
the Grand Moguls of Delhi, never lost their passion for works of art.
The Emperor Shah-Jahan, who, in order to assume the crown, had revolted
against his father and killed off all his brothers, found time, on
the very day of his accession, to inscribe his <i>ex-libris</i> on
a magnificent copy of one of the six poems of Jāmī; it is true that
this volume was a family record, and that it had been copied for his
ancestor, the sovereign of Herat, Sultan Husain Mirza. The Timurids of
Hindustan retained this passion for fine books until the worst days of
their history. Copies bearing the seal of Mohammed Shah or of Ferrukh
Siyyar are not at all rare, and Shah Alem II enriched the library of
the Grand Moguls even at the time when he was being torn between the
English, the Mahrattas and the French, and when his empire was on the
point of passing under a foreign dominion. ¶ The influence of Chinese
art is even more marked in the paintings of the Timurid school of
Khorassan than in those of the Mongols of Persia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span> and it is open to
us to ask ourselves whether they were executed by Persians trained in
the school of the Chinese, or by Chinese striving to produce something
in the Persian taste. If a doubt be permissible in the case of the
manuscript of the ‘Ascension of Mohammed,’ none such can be entertained
concerning a manuscript which was copied at Samarcand for Sultan
Mirza Ulugh Beg and which contains the Arab text of an astronomical
treatise famous in the East, that of ‘Abd ur-Rahmān el-Sūfī. One of
the pictures adorning this magnificent manuscript is reproduced in the
present article, and it is easy to see, even in the absence of colour,
that the drawing shows an evident Chinese influence. The lightness of
the outlines and of the painting, reduced to a few tints of Chinese
ink in the shadows and a few threads of colour, reminds one in an
extraordinary manner of the methods of the Japanese artists. This same
characteristic occurs also, although in a less pronounced degree, in
the miniatures on the manuscript of the ‘Ascension of Mohammed’; but
the heads of the chimera on which the Prophet is mounted and of the
angels recall the chubby faces on certain paintings or certain ivories
of the Far East. ¶ We know from an undoubted source that the Timurids
of Turkestan and Eastern Persia were pleased to make calls upon the
artists of the Celestial empire, and that one of those sultans had set
up at the gates of Samarcand a Trianon in Chinese porcelain which had
been brought in sections, with every piece numbered, to the Athens of
Turkestan. It is therefore no matter for surprise that we should find
in the paintings of many manuscripts which formed the libraries of
Herat and Samarcand traces of so deep and so protracted an influence.
These miniatures are always infinitely better executed than are those
of the Mongolian school, and we feel that they appeal to men of a
different and more refined form of culture than the cavalry leaders
who organized the bold raids across the Asiatic continent. They
represent fewer scenes of carnage and, above all, fewer horsemen barbed
and iron-clad to their eyes than fill the paintings of the Mongolian
manuscripts. The sultans of Turkestan made war upon one another in
order to steal the others’ crowns, but they did not do so as brutes
greedy of slaughter and scenes of bloodshed: often warfare was their
only means of living and of defending themselves against the incessant
attacks of their rapacious kinsmen. ¶ The transition from the school
of Turkestan at the time of the princes of the House of Timur to the
third great school of painting in Persia, that of the Sefevæans, was
not so clearly defined as that which separates the Mongolian from the
Timurid school. There was, towards the end of the fifteenth century, a
certain period during which the Persian artists endeavoured to produce
something new, while retaining, in a great measure, the method of the
miniature-painters of Turkestan. To this transition period belongs
the manuscript of the ‘Book of the Kings,’ the property of M. de
Rothschild, of which two reproductions will be found in these pages,
and also the miniature representing a hunting-scene which is taken
from a splendid manuscript, dated 1527, from the divan of Mīr ‘Alī
Shīr Navā’ī, Vizir to the Timurid Sultan Husain Mirza. ¶ Obviously
the master-pieces of Mussulman painting are to be sought among the
miniatures executed at Herat and Samarcand in the fifteenth century;
but this does not prevent the miniatures painted in Western Persia
under the reign of the Sefevis (fifteenth to seventeenth century) from
being splendid works of art. The number of illuminated manuscripts
dating from this period is relatively large. This does not imply that
there were many more painted in Persia under Shah Abbas than during the
time of the Timurids, but simply that, being more modern, there were
fewer of them lost.</p>

is an undefinable feeling of romance and sentiment that forcibly
strikes even the most callous who visit Winchester College. Founded by
William of Wykeham in 1393 for the purpose of providing free education
for the sons of those who could not otherwise have afforded it, as well
as a means of supplying the country with an enlightened priesthood,
it remains to-day the oldest and one of the greatest of England’s
public schools. The royal licence to found the college, granted by
Richard II, empowers Wykeham to ‘acquire the site and build a hall or
college to the honour and glory of God and our Lady, and to settle
in it a warden and seventy scholars who should study grammar within
its halls and to grant them a charter.’ This first building took six
years to complete, and the sum of £1.014 8s. 3d. was spent upon its
construction, a sum that would represent about £20,000 according
to the present value of money. ¶ As Winchester was at one time the
capital of England, many kings made it their chief seat of residence,
and many important parliaments were held there, and it was no doubt
from this traditional importance that reigning sovereigns, and the
highest dignitaries of Church and State, continually paid visits to the
college. It would be otherwise difficult to account for the very large
amount of ecclesiastical plate and precious vestments, in addition
to the great quantity of secular plate, that was at different times
in the possession of the college. The number of rose-water basins
with ewers and spoons enumerated in one inventory alone proves that
the entertainments must have been of a highly important nature. ¶
The earliest record of a royal gift in plate is of 1449, when Henry
VI gave a tabernacle of gold, Margaret of Anjou about the same time
presenting a pair of silver-gilt basins, weighing 114 oz., with the
enamelled arms of England on one and those of France on the other.
Before this date King Henry had paid many visits to the college, being
desirous of gaining information on the subject of its working rules and
statutes, in order to apply the same to the two similar institutions he
was about to found. Another visit was on the occasion of his marriage,
when it is stated in one of the records that the wine and beer for the
entertainment of the royal suite cost two shillings and fourpence, a
sum that does not appear excessive for court refreshments. Doubtless
it was in return for the information and hospitality received that he
produced the tabernacle and basins. The only recorded visit of Henry’s
successor, Edward IV, was in 1469, when he was sufficiently impressed
by the school to lend a live lion for the edification of the boys,
but he does not appear to have made any presentation of plate; nor
is there record of any particular interest taken in the college by
either Richard III or Henry VII. During the next reign—which might
with justice be called the reign of terror so far as gothic plate
was concerned—Thomas Cromwell, representing the king as vicegerent
and vicar-general, paid a formal visit to the college. Perhaps the
authorities, scenting the coming storm, thought that the presentation
to him of a standing salt from the college plate chest might prove a
politic precaution; for in the records this entry occurs: ‘Sol. pro
reparacione unius salsarii dat. Mro Cromwell secretario Dn̄i Regis pro
favore suo habendo in causis Collegii v<i>s</i>. x<i>d</i>.’ A few
weeks later, when the king was at Wolvesey Castle, two oxen, ten sheep,
and twelve capons were sent to him and graciously accepted. Whether
on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span> account of the gift of the salt to Cromwell, or of the offering of
sheep and chickens, Henry VIII spared the college plate; his indulgence
in this respect is proved when it is seen, from the following inventory
taken in 1525 of the secular college plate, how great the temptation
must have been:—</p>

<p>¶ There is also an inventory of what was given to the college chapel
by Wykeham and other benefactors, consisting of silver plate and gilt
3,892 oz., gold plate and articles in gold 91⅞ oz., which Henry VIII
must have found even more difficult to resist. Out of the amount of
gothic plate mentioned in these two inventories but one piece remains;
this is the so-called ‘Election Cup’ illustrated on <a href="#i_148">Plate I</a>. ¶ The
death of Henry VIII in 1547 relieved the college from the threatened
danger of dissolution, but not from the sequestration of its plate;
the blow fell in the sixth and seventh year of Edward VI, when the
plate was seized, together with all the plate and other ornaments
belonging to the ‘cathedrall churche and other parishes and chapells
within the said cytie of Winchester.’ The different ‘parcells’ are
minutely described in the indenture that forms a receipt, and beautiful
‘parcells’ they must have been. ¶ The college was honoured by a visit
from Queen Mary on the occasion of her marriage with Philip, which took
place in Winchester cathedral in 1554, and it received small gifts of
alms from the royal couple; but neither Mary nor Elizabeth attempted
to make good the confiscation of plate that had taken place during
their brother’s reign. However, in 1565 the college began once more
to accumulate plate, and amongst other things bought a ‘pousshe-pot
for wine.’ Some few of these purchases and presentations are still in
existence, and are given in the illustrations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
but the greater part disappeared in various ways during the
seventeenth century. As an instalment towards replacing this, Dr.
Nicolas, a warden, presented in 1861 a large silver-gilt bowl and
two silver-gilt salvers, and that others were prompted to follow his
example is proved by the fine specimens of Charles II silver still in
possession of the college. At the beginning of the next century Dr.
Burton became head-master, and consolidated the branch of the school
known as commoners. As many of these pupils were of noble birth, a
special and well-appointed table was kept for their use, and much of
the older plate was in 1740 condemned to the melting-pot in order
to provide the necessary silver forks, spoons, etc., for the use of
these fashionable young gentlemen. It was Dr. Burton’s practice to
accept gifts of portraits and plate from his pupils in place of what
was termed ‘leaving money’; on his death he bequeathed the portraits
to the college, but not the presentation plate, some of which still
exists as the property of his descendants, and was exhibited at the
Fine Arts Society last winter.</p>

</div>

<p>From the slight records from which it
is possible to gain information, and for which I am much indebted to
Mr. T. F. Kirby (the bursar) and Mr. M. J. Rendall, it is very evident
that at one time Winchester College was unusually rich in plate, and
it is most interesting to have brought to light the few beautiful
specimens that still remain, for not only were silver lovers unaware
of its existence, but the college authorities had little notion of the
rarity and value of their pieces. They are all in an extraordinarily
fine state of preservation, and have not suffered in any way from
repairing or regilding. It is a source of comfort that, belonging to
such an institution as Winchester College, they are beyond the reach
of the American millionaire, and will receive all proper care from the
authorities. As the plate is so little known, I have thought it best to
describe each important piece in catalogue form.</p>

<p><i><a href="#i_148">Plate I.</a></i>—Silver-gilt cup with cover, called ‘The Election Cup’;
height, 17½ ins.; diameter, 6½ ins.; weight, 69 oz. 9 dwt. The bowl,
which resembles in shape the Anathema and Leigh cups, is moveable, and
attaches to the stem by a double socket and flange; it is embossed
with decorated and graduated escallops on a matted ground. The stem
is of channelled and truncated form, finishing in palm-like points
where it meets the bowl and foot, which is similar in decoration to
the rest of the cup. The base is edged by an open scrolled moulding
formed of leaves surmounted by a ladder moulding, finishing in a very
bold and unusually tall cresting. The cover to this remarkable cup is
of cupola shape, rising to a slender shaft fashioned like the stem and
necked by a cinque-foil; this supports a Tudor crown, the cap showing
a surface once filled in with enamel; the finials and bands belonging
to the crown are missing. The cover is embossed in the same manner as
the bowl, and bordered with the same moulding and tall cresting as the
base, pierced in both cases to hold precious stones, which are now
replaced by coloured glass. The cup is in remarkable preservation, and
has its original gilding. It has no hall-marks, but is, without doubt,
English, circa 1520; the boldness of the cresting and workmanship,
together with the shape of the bowl, exactly coincides with the few
contemporary English pieces in existence. It was presented by Warden
More in 1523, and is the sole remaining piece from the wonderful store
of gothic plate once possessed by the college.</p>

<p><i><a href="#i_151">Plate II.</a></i>—A rose-water dish, parcel gilt, 16 ins. in
diameter; weight, 48 oz. II dwt.; hall-mark, London 1562; maker’s
mark, a unicorn’s head in a shield. The border of the dish, which is
gilt, and 2 ins. in width, is engraved with panels of strapwork and
arabesques, enclosing the words, in Lombardic lettering, RADOLPHUS
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>HENSLOWE A<sup>o</sup> DNI 1563 CUI DEUS RETRIBUAT IN ILL DIE HANC PELVIM CUM
SUO GUTTURNIO DE NOVO FECIT. The centre is composed of one boss raised
on another enclosing a print bearing the Wykeham arms enamelled in
their tinctures; argent two chevronels sable, between three roses
gules, barbed and seeded proper within a garb. Round the lower base
runs the legend, also in Lombardic lettering, MANERS MAKET MAN QUOTHE
WYLLYAM WYKEHAM. The face of this boss is decorated with baskets of
fruit and trophies of arms in repoussé, gilt on a matted ground; the
bason of the dish is of plain silver. ¶ The companion ewer, with cover
(height, 8½ ins.; weight, 47 oz. 11 dwt., and with marks the same as
dish), is of unusually beautiful proportions. The cover, of depressed
form, is surmounted by a rosace finial containing the Wykeham arms
in enamel; the rest of the cover is embossed with baskets of fruit
and trophies of arms. The body of the ewer is cylindrical, and this,
as well as the narrow spout, is decorated at the top and centre with
gilt bands of scrolled arabesques, enclosing engraved medallions of
heads in the foreign taste. The stem is fluted, and the foot covered
with a repoussé of a lion’s mask and human heads in cartouches between
bunches of fruit, and is edged with reeded and ovolo mouldings. The
billet is formed of two masks in profile enclosing a bunch of leaves,
and the graceful bow handle is engraved down the back with panels of
arabesques. This beautiful dish and ewer much resemble those belonging
to Lord Newton, of Lyme, exhibited in 1902 at the Burlington Fine Arts
Club, and possess all the characteristics of the finest Elizabethan
work. Both dish and ewer are in perfect preservation, and have the
original parcel gilding.</p>

<p><i><a href="#i_154a">Plate IIIa.</a></i>—Sweetmeat dish of tazza shape; diameter, 7 ins.;
height, 5 ins.; weight, 15 oz. 9 dwt.; hall-mark, London 1594. The bowl
is engraved on the inside, with two bands of strapwork enclosing panels
of arabesque design; the centre is of similar decoration surrounded by
a double strap. The stem is plain save for an embossed ring indented
with dotted lines, the same decoration being repeated on the foot
between a double strap, and connected to the stem by a ladder moulding.
The piece is singularly simple in its ornamentation, and it should
be observed how much of its beauty is dependent on the perfection of
the plain line engraving. These dishes were used for sweetmeats and
handed to the guests; the tazza form was taken from the Italian and
French dishes that were so much in vogue in those countries during the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p><i><a href="#i_154a">Plate IIIb.</a></i>—Small standing salt, gilt; height, 4½ ins.; weight,
15 oz. 9 dwt.; hallmark, London 1596. It is in the form of a hexagonal
plinth; the panels forming the sides are filled with an upright design
of foliated arabesques in low relief on a matted ground, divided at the
angles by a plain ribbed moulding, connected at the top and base by a
fine ladder moulding between two fillets; the top and base coincide in
design, and are composed of a slight ogee embossed with a lea moulding
of Persian origin. The simple repetition of design throughout this
little standing salt constitutes its charm, each space being most
admirably filled. The cover to this salt is, unfortunately, missing;
it would probably have been of cupola shape, bearing a vase finial
surmounted by a little figure.</p>

<p><i><a href="#i_154b">Plate IIIc.</a></i>—Cup with cover, gilt; height, 11¼ ins.; diameter of
bowl, 9½ ins.; both hall-marked London 1682; maker’s mark, ‘R. L.’ in
a shield over a fleur-de-luce; weight, 118 oz. 15 dwt. The cup, which
stands on a base ¾ in. in height, is of porringer shape, decorated with
a surbase of upright and repoussé acanthus, alternating with plain
leaves in lower relief; above this in fine line engraving are the
Poulett arms within a mantling of acanthus, and the inscription, ‘Ex
dono prænobilis Caroli Dm̄i Marchionis Winton,’ etc. The scroll handles
are cast solid, and terminate in animals’ heads.</p>

<p>The cover is of flattened form and plain except for a central
enrichment of acanthus in a spiral design, and finishes in an
open-worked knop of the same leaves. The condition of this unusually
large porringer cup is surprising. It has the original gilding, and
the sharp yet round modelling of the ornament shows to what perfection
this form of decoration was carried. The rapid deterioration of this
acanthus design in William III’s reign goes far towards explaining
the reason for its lasting such a short period. The acanthus scrolled
handles are a little small for the otherwise perfect proportions of
this very remarkable cup.</p>

<p><i><a href="#i_157">Plate IVa.</a></i>—Rose-water dish; diameter, 17¼ ins.; weight, 63 oz.;
no hall mark; maker’s mark, monogram C. R. in a shield; date, circa
1613. The dish is quite plain, with an engraved line on the edge. The
arms per pale of Winchester College and the donor are engraved on the
centre boss, round which runs the inscription, ‘Ex dono Georgii Rives
Sacræ Theologiæ Doct. huius Collegii socii deinde Novi Coll. custodis
in usum quotidianum Vicecustodis istius Coll. prope Winton Anno Domini
1613.’ The companion ewer of same date, with same maker’s mark;
height, 7⅛ ins.; diameter, 4½ ins.; weight, 23 oz. 10 dwt. This is
also perfectly plain, with wide bow handle and long curved spout; the
foot is of trumpet shape spreading to a plain stepped base. Both dish
and ewer are good examples of the plain plate that was slowly coming
into fashion in this country during the early part of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p><i><a href="#i_157">Plate IVb.</a></i>—Small standing cup and cover, gilt; height, 14.
ins.; hall-mark, London 1632; maker’s mark, P. C. over a rose in a
shield. The bowl of the cup is matted with a broad plain border at
the lip, round which runs the inscription, ‘Ex dono Hugonis Barker
legū Doctoris olim huius Collegii Scholaris ac Consanguinei fundatoris
eiusdem Collegii ac eo nomine in numerū Scholariū eiusdem admissi.’
Below this in a circle are engraved the arms of the donor. The stem is
of baluster shape usual to the cups of this period, and plain save for
a matting on the knop, and where it joins the foot there is a repoussé
ornament of small leaves; the base is composed of simple mouldings. The
cover is of cupola shape with a wide brim; the surface is decorated
with a matted ground, and the whole is surmounted by a plain finial of
vase-shaped form. This plain plate with a granulated or matted surface
was much made in the north of Germany, Denmark, and Sweden, and was
probably introduced into this country through the influence of Anne of
Denmark, the queen of James I.</p>

<p><i><a href="#i_160">Plate Va.</a></i>—Tankard and cover; height, 7 ins.; weight, 34 oz.
11 dwt.; marks, London 1614; maker’s mark, O. S., with pellets in a
shield. This early Jacobean tankard is plain throughout and of globular
or tankard form. Round the neck runs a band on which is engraved
‘Facile contemnit omnia qui semper cogitat se esse moriturum.’ As an
additional emphasis of this sad but true remark, the billet of the
cover is formed of a human skull holding a scroll between its teeth,
and on the body of the tankard is engraved the arms of the donor with
the inscription, ‘Ex dono Johanis Bolney quondā de sanguine fundatoris
Jstius Collegii St. Marie Winton Aō dm̄ni 1614.’ The handle is
depressed in the bow and finishes in a square whistle end. Tankards or
flagons of this shape are extremely rare, and owe the origin of their
form to the stoneware jug of Tudor days.</p>

<p><i><a href="#i_160">Plate Vb.</a></i>—Standing salt; height, 6½ ins.; diameter, 9 ins.
at top, q¼ ins. at base; weight, 47 oz. 5 dwt.; marks, London 1664;
maker’s mark undecipherable. The salt is plain, cylindrical, and of X
form; the three short curved arms that spring from the slightly convex
top were intended to hold a napkin to protect the salt, or, as is to
be seen in pictures of the time, for the support of a small dish for
olives or caviare. On the fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span> trumpet sweep of the base are engraved
the arms of Wykeham and of the donor within feather mantling, and the
inscription, ‘Legatum M<sup>r̄i</sup> Michaelis Bold M. Art Collegij Btae
Mariae Winton.’ The edge is finished in a simple half-round and step
moulding.</p>

<p><i><a href="#i_160">Plate Vc.</a></i>—Tankard with lid, parcel gilt; height, 6 ins.;
weight, 25 oz. 9 dwt.; marks, London 1649. The tankard is cylindrical
and straight-sided, hooped and staved in imitation of a barrel; the
lid is quite flat, and engraved with the arms of the see within a
garter; the billet is of half skull type, and the curious short handle
is of rectangular and irregular form. The barrel decoration at this
date (the first year of the Commonwealth) is unusual to find, although
the fashion was much adopted towards the end of the same century. The
parcel gilding is original.</p>

<p><i><a href="#i_163">Plate VIa.</a></i>—Steeple cup and cover, gilt; total height, 19 ins.;
height of cup, 12 ins.; weight, 38 oz. 5 dwt.; marks, London 1615;
maker’s mark, T. F. in monogram in a shield. The cover is surmounted by
a perforated spire of graceful proportions, supported on three brackets
of female form. The cover and cup are decorated with scrolled acanthus
and fruit in low relief and fine line engraving; the stem is of the
composite character usual to these cups, and bears the last traces of
Renaissance influence. The cup, although in excellent preservation, has
been regilt. There are many steeple cups of this type in existence, but
few are so happy in their proportions as this specimen.</p>

<p><i><a href="#i_163">Plate VIb.</a></i>—Tall standing cup or hanap with cover. Total height,
24 ins.; cup without cover, 17¼ ins.; diameter, 8⅛ ins.; weight, 124
oz. 17 dwt.; marks, London 1680; maker’s mark, T. C. with a fish and a
<i>fleur de luce</i> in a shield. The bowl of this very tall standing
cup is plain in shape, ornamented with a surbase of upright acanthus,
above which runs an embossed laurelled band; above and below this band
are the following inscriptions in Greek and Latin:—</p>

<p class="center">
κρᾶσις ἀγαθοῦ δαίμονος<br>
Sivè<br>
Poculum Charitatis<br>
In Usum<br>
Collegij B<sup>tae</sup> Mariae Winton<br>
propè Winton</p>

<p>The stem is of ordinary baluster shape, engraved and chased with
laurelling and acanthus. The base and cover resemble each other in
their decoration, and the latter ends in a mushroom-shaped finial,
from which spring two arms supporting a heart. This form of standing
cup was universal from 1640 to 1690, and, though deficient in artistic
construction, possesses interest as being the last recognized design of
loving cup mounted on to a tall stem.</p>

<p><i><a href="#i_165">Plate VII.</a></i>—Ecclesiastical plate belonging to the college
chapel. Two chalices with covers, gilt; marks, London 1611; maker’s
mark, R. P. in a shield over a <i>fleur de luce</i>. These are
perfectly plain and of the type that was usual during the first years
of the seventeenth century. The two tall flagons are of tankard shape,
gilt; marks, London 1627; maker’s mark, R. S. over a heart. These
tankards are of a shape that was common to both ecclesiastical and
secular use, the entasis of the drum, on which are engraved the arms of
the donor per pale with those of the college, gives great elegance to
its tall and plain columnar form, and the mouldings to the petticoat
base are unusually sharp and well proportioned. The large alms dish
is gilt; width, 17¼ ins.; marks, London 1681; maker’s mark illegible.
The dish is plain, but edged with a reeded moulding; on the border
is engraved an inscription set in feather mantling between the arms
of Wykeham and those of the donor. There are many other pieces of
ecclesiastical and secular plate belonging to the college for which
there is not space here. These consist of chalices, patens, salvers,
porringers and tankards, which, although of great merit, are not of
corresponding interest to the pieces represented in the illustrations.</p>

a strange coincidence those paintings in the ‘Cappella Maggiore’
of Santa Trinita to which the entries in Alesso’s ‘Ricordi, Libro
B,’ refer, have alone been preserved of all the frescoes once in the
chapel, with the exception of some fragments of the lunettes on the
lateral walls. The last but one of these entries records the purchase
of cinnabar for the wings of the seraphim on the soffit of the arch
opening into the ‘Crociera.’<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The first entry in ‘Libro B’ is dated
March 9, 1470–1; but according to an abstract of an entry in ‘Libro
A,’ Alesso ‘received the commission to paint the “Cappella Maggiore”
of Santa Trinita from Bongianni Gianfigliazzi, for 200 gold ducats, on
July 1, 1471, and undertook to finish the work within the period of
five to seven years.’<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The latter date, no doubt, was that of the
execution of the ‘writing,’ subscribed by the hand of Misser Bongianni,
which Alesso held, and to which he refers in the ‘ricordo’ on the
first page of ‘Libro B.’ In the interval between these two dates the
painter began the cartoons for the figures of the prophets and the
other ornaments of the vault. On April 28, 1471, he bought ‘16 quires
of coarse paper (<i>carta da straccia</i>) in royal folio, at 5 soldi
the quire, for making the “spolverizzi” of the prophets and the other
“spolverizzi” that occur in the said vault.’ The ‘spolverizzi’ properly
were the outlines pounced upon the plaster, by means of the pricked
cartoon; but here, by a figure of speech, Alesso clearly intends the
cartoons themselves. The more usual method of transferring a cartoon
was to trace the outlines, by means of a metal style, on to the fresh
plaster, as Vasari recommends.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Pricked cartoons seem to have been
more commonly employed in the case of embroideries and ‘drappi.’<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> ¶
Having in the meantime purchased certain colours for the work, Alesso,
at length, on August 29, 1471, paid various sums for moving the boxes
containing his colours, etc., into chapel, and for the purchase of
brushes and pipkins in preparation for the actual painting of the
vault. There are two entries of that date: the first records that he
bought ‘from Bernardino di Ventura, the pencil-maker, 58 pencils of
minever, between coarse and fine, one with another, great and small,’
costing, lire 1 soldi 12; the second, that he spent, ‘between new
pipkins and small pots, and hogs’-hair and pack thread for making
pencils of hogs’-hair, and for the carriage of chests and trestles for
the work of painting the said chapel, lire 3 soldi 5.’ Alesso, however,
does not appear to have proceeded very far with the actual painting of
the vault until the following spring; for on April 12, 1472, he records
that he bought ‘five pounds of azzurro della Magnia (namely, biadetto)
for making the bed under the fine blue, and this I bought from Lorenzo
di Piero, the painter, in Borgo Sant’Apostoli, at the price of 5
soldi the ounce.’<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> This ‘biadetto’ was probably identical with the
‘sbiadato’ mentioned by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span> Cennini, in a passage in which he says, that
‘a blue like sbiadato, and very similar to azzurro della Magnia,’ may
be made with indigo and white, ‘biacca’ or ‘bianco sangiovanni.’<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Alesso would seem to have painted <i>a fresco</i> the blue backgrounds
behind the figures of the prophets on the vault with this ‘biadetto,’
using it as a ‘bed’ for the fine azzurro della Magnia, which he
afterward applied <i>a secco</i>.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> It cost one-fifth, or even less,
of the genuine azzurro della Magnia, and, no doubt, resembled it in
colour. The genuine azzurro della Magnia seems to have been not easily
obtainable in Florence; and Alesso is generally careful to record how
he came by his purchases. On March 7, 1470–1, according to the first
entry in ‘Libro B,’ he bought ‘2 pounds 9 ounces of azzurro di Magnia
from Cardinale del Bulletta, at the price of 26 soldi the ounce’;
and on the 12th of the same month, 4 pounds 2½ ounces, at 33 soldi
the ounce. On April 31, 1471, he bought 1 pound 7 ounces, ‘from a
German, in a bladder,’ at 31 soldi the ounce. ‘On 25 day of September,
1472,’ records Alesso, ‘I bought 2 pounds of azzurro di Magnia from
Giovanni d’Andrea, glazier, at the price of 25 soldi the ounce; he
said it belonged to a gossip of his, a courier, who brought it from
Venice: the said Giovanni wanted 4 soldi to go drinking with.’ This
Giovanni d’Andrea was the glazier who, in partnership with Il Lastra,
had executed the window of the ‘Cappella Maggiore’ of Santa Trinita,
from Alesso’s design. Finally, on January 13, 1472–3, Alesso bought
2 pounds 10 ounces, ‘from a Pole,’ at 20 soldi the ounce; ‘a clear,
beautiful, finely-ground blue,’ he adds with satisfaction. At that time
the painter was about to begin the lunettes on the lateral walls of the
chapel. ¶ Cennini calls azzurro della Magnia ‘a natural colour that is
found in and around silver lodes.’ ‘Much,’ he adds, ‘is obtained in
Germany [La Magnia, whence its name], and also in the country about
Siena.’<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Milanesi, in the notes to his edition of Cennini, says
that this blue was an oxide of cobalt; but Mrs. Herringham, with more
probability, identifies the colour with blue carbonate of copper,
commonly called blue verditer: in the same way, she identifies ‘verde
azzurro,’ which Cennini says was made artificially from ‘azzurro della
Magnia,’ with green verditer, which is also a carbonate of copper.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
Alesso records in ‘Libro B,’ that, on March 20, 1470–1, he bought 6
pounds of ‘verde azzurro,’ at 14 soldi the ounce. ¶ It is worthy of
remark that in a work of the importance of these frescoes, executed for
so wealthy a patron as Messer Bongianni Gianfigliazzi, Alesso should
not have used ultramarine, but a blue which cost but a twentieth part
of that ‘noble, beautiful, and most perfect beyond all colours.’<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
According to the entries cited above, Alesso bought his azzurro della
Magnia at prices varying from 20 soldi to 33 soldi the ounce.</p>

<p>Few other colours are specified by name in these ‘Ricordi.’ On May 24,
1471, Alesso purchased 4 pounds 5 ounces of yellow, namely, ‘arzicha,’
at 13 soldi the ounce. Cennini calls ‘arzica’ a colour chemically
produced and little used, but more at Florence than elsewhere. He adds
that it perishes on exposure to the air, and is not good for walls,
but mixed with a little azzurro della Magnia and giallorino it makes
a beautiful green.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Mrs. Herringham suggests that ‘arzica’ may be
massicot, called azarcon in Spain.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> ¶ On September 1, 1471, Alesso
bought 5 ounces of fine lake at 14 soldi the ounce.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span> The colour was
probably used for the purple robe of the David. Lastly, on September
14, 1472, he bought ‘8 ounces of fine cinnabar to make the cherubim
of the arch before the said chapel,’ at 2 soldi 8 danari the ounce.
This was the vermilion for the wings of the seraphim, which still
remain on the soffit on the arch. ¶ By June 1472 the painting of the
vault had so far advanced that Alesso began to buy the gold for the
ornaments. On June 13 he bought from Domenico, the gold-beater, 1,700
pieces of fine gold ‘laid upon tin-foil,’ for lire 61; on June 15,
from Giovanni, the gold-beater, called Il Rosso, 500 pieces, also on
foil, for lire 18; on June 23, 4,000 pieces of fine gold, at 3 lire
4 soldi the hundred, from a Genoese; and on June 28, 86 sheets of
yellow foil, on which to lay the gold, for lire 8. Lastly, on July 9,
1472, he bought ‘8 pounds of liquid varnish, to apply them upon the
vault, namely, the ornaments of fine gold.’ In all this Alesso appears
to have followed the method set forth by Cennini, in cap. 99 of his
‘Trattato.’<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> ¶ But one other entry in these ‘Ricordi’ calls for
any remark: on July 24, 1471, Alesso ‘bought four pounds of linseed
oil at the price of 4 soldi the pound.’ What purpose was this oil
intended to serve? Was it for some oil ‘tempera’? Vasari, speaking of
these paintings of Santa Trinita, says that ‘Alesso laid them in <i>a
fresco</i>, and afterwards finished them <i>a secco</i>, tempering
the colours with yolk of egg, mixed with liquid varnish made over the
fire’; he adds that Alesso ‘thought that this tempera would protect the
paintings against damp; but it was of so strong a nature that where
it has been applied freely the work has in many places flaked away,
and so, whereas he thought to have found a rare and most beautiful
secret, he remained deceived by his opinion.’<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Without attempting
to discuss the nature of the ‘tempera’ which is here described, I may
recall the fact that Domenico Veneziano, who was undoubtedly Alesso’s
master, is celebrated by Vasari on account of ‘the new method which
he employed of colouring in oil’; and the books of the hospital of
Santa Maria Nuova record payments for very considerable quantities
of linseed oil which that master used for the lost paintings in the
‘Cappella Maggiore’ of Sant’ Egidio.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Domenico, no doubt, possessed
the secret of some improvement upon the old method of painting in oil
on walls, which Cennino Cennini, who describes it at length in the
‘Libro dell’&#160;Arte,’ cap. lxxxix.–cap. xciv., says ‘was much in use
among the Germans.’ ¶ Alesso, as I have said, originally undertook, on
July 1, 1471, to paint the ‘Cappella Maggiore’ of Santa Trinita for
200 gold florins, and to finish the work within a period of five to
seven years. It was not, however, until January 19, 1496–97, after an
interval of more than twenty-five years, that the total amount to be
paid him for finished work was estimated by Cosimo Rosselli, Benozzo
Gozzoli, Pietro Perugino and Filippino Lippi at 1,000 gold florins.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
In other words, Alesso had spent upon the work five times the minimum
period originally stipulated for its completion, and he was awarded
five times the original sum for which he had undertaken to complete the
chapel. Two causes appear to have contributed to this delay. The one
was that Alesso’s method of laying-in his paintings <i>a fresco</i>,
and finishing them <i>a secco</i>, admitted of endless elaboration, and
a consequent expenditure of time, which pure fresco painting did not
admit of. The other was, that shortly after receiving the commission
for the chapel Alesso appears to have turned his attention to reviving
the art of mosaic, which had almost died out in Florence. We first
hear of Alesso working in mosaic in 1481, in which year he restored
the figures on the façade of San Miniato a Monte.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> In 1483 he was
appointed by the consuls of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span> the Arte de’ Mercanti to restore the
mosaics in the tribune of the baptistery of San Giovanni, ‘there being
no one, in all the dominion and jurisdiction of Florence, but he,
who then understood that art’: in consideration of which the consuls
resolved to convey to him, ‘for the term of his natural life, such real
property as would yield 30 florins yearly, upon the condition that he
bound himself, so long as he lived, to repair and restore the mosaics
of San Giovanni.’<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In accordance with this resolution two houses in
the Piazza di San Giovanni, belonging to the Arte de’ Mercanti, were
assigned to Alesso on February 26, 1483–4,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and by two instruments
of the same date, engrossed by the notary, Ser Giovanni di Jacopo
de’ Migliorelli, Alesso re-leased the two houses to the persons who
were already in possession of them at the date of the assignment.
These instruments are printed, for the first time, in the appendix
to this article.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> ¶ The decoration of the ‘Cappella Maggiore’ of
Santa Trinita, and the restoration of the mosaics in the baptistery of
San Giovanni and San Miniato a Monte, appear to have almost entirely
engrossed the last thirty years of Alesso’s life. During that time we
hear of no work of importance undertaken by him, with the exception of
the lost altar-piece of Sant’ Ambrogio, which he began in 1470. Messer
Bongianni Gianfigliazzi died on November 7, 1484, and was buried in his
chapel at Santa Trinita, long before Alesso had brought its frescoes
to a conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The work, however, was continued at the instance
of his son, Jacopo Gianfigliazzi; and Stefano Rosselli records in his
‘Sepoltuario Fiorentino,’ that at the time he was writing, c. 1657,
the basement of Alesso’s altar-piece in the ‘Cappella Maggiore’ of
Santa Trinita bore the inscription: ‘Jacobus Gianfigliazzius Bongiannis
Equitis Fil<i>ius</i>, sua erga De<i>um</i> Pietate.’<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> ¶ Of the
paintings that once decorated the walls of this chapel we possess but
some partial and imperfect accounts. Vasari, to whom we chiefly owe the
meagre notices which are extant, says that they consisted of ‘stories
from the Old Testament.’ Alesso, he says, ‘drew many portraits from
the life; and in the story of the aforesaid chapel [of Santa Trinita],
in which he represented the Queen of Sheba going to hear the wisdom of
Solomon, he drew Lorenzo de’ Medici, the Magnificent, who was father
of Pope Leo X, and Lorenzo dalla Volpaia, a most excellent master of
dials, and a great astrologer.’ ‘In another story which is opposite to
this, Alesso drew Luigi Guicciardini the elder, Luca Pitti, Diotisalvi
Neroni, Giuliano de’ Medici, father of Pope Clement VII; and next to
the stone pilaster [of the arch opening into the church] Gherardo
Gianfigliazzi the elder, and Messer Bongianni, knight, wearing a blue
habit and a collar round his neck, together with Jacopo and Giovanni
of the same family. Near to these last are Filippo Strozzi and Messer
Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli, astrologer.’<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> What the subject of this
latter story may have been, we do not now know. According to Giovanni
Cinelli, in his edition of the ‘Bellezze di Firenze,’ published in
1677, the other story of the Queen of Sheba was on the left wall of the
chapel, ‘dal Corno del Vangelo.’ Cinelli, after quoting this passage
from Vasari, adds that ‘in the angle of the choir, on the left side,
there is painted a Cain in the act of striking his brother Abel, a
figure which is very admirable in its attitude, and which expresses
in its countenance the malice and hatred which Cain bore in his heart
towards his brother: and it is greatly esteemed by the connoisseurs;
so much so, that when the cardinal of the serene house of Este came to
Florence and visited this church, he desired to see and consider with
attention so fine a painting.’<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Already, when Vasari wrote in 1568, the frescoes in the ‘Cappella
Maggiore’ of Santa Trinita ‘had begun to flake away in many
places.’<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The last writer to allude to their indifferent condition
is Giuseppe Richa, who speaks of them as ‘not a little consumed and
spoiled by time.’<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> That was in 1755; five years later, in 1760,
Alesso’s ‘stories’ were ruthlessly destroyed or covered with whitewash,
and the walls of the chapel decorated with ‘stucchi’ in the taste of
the time.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> During the recent restoration of the church, in 1890–7,
the paintings of the four patriarchs on the vault of the chapel, the
seraphim on the soffit of the vault, and the fragments of the lunettes
on the lateral walls of the chapel, were found under the whitewash,
and restored by Signor Dario Chini. [Plate III.] ¶ The vault itself
is divided into four triangular compartments by the intersecting
ribs of the vault, which spring from the four corbels at the angles
of the chapel. In the compartment above the window of the chapel is
a seated figure of Noah, in an ample cloak of dark green, worn over
an under-dress of a reddish colour. He holds some object which is
now undecipherable in his right hand; and beside him, on the left,
is placed the ark. ¶ In the compartment above the left wall of the
chapel is a seated figure of Abraham clad in a yellow robe lined with
green, over an under-dress of vermilion. In his right hand he holds the
sacrificial knife, and at his feet kneels his son Isaac, bound and clad
in white. In the compartment above the right wall is a seated figure of
Moses, holding the two tables of the Law in his hands. The robe, which
falls over the knees of the figure, is vermilion in colour, and the
underdress appears to have been a dark leaf-green. In the compartment
above the arch is a seated figure of David playing upon a psaltery with
three sound-holes. He is attired in a purple mantle lined with green,
which almost entirely envelops his figure. The purple of this robe is
now much perished. All these four figures are relieved against blue
backgrounds, broken by rays of gold which appear to proceed from the
figures; and all the four compartments are surrounded by borders of
fruit and flowers upon a vermilion ground. The ribs of the vault are
painted with green foliage intertwined with a running ribbon, and the
keystone of the vault is blazoned with the arms of the Gianfigliazzi:
or, a lion rampant azure. On the soffit of the arch opening into the
chapel is painted, on a blue ground, the series of seraphim with
vermilion wings, to which allusion has already been made. ¶ In the
lunette on the left wall, immediately below the figure of Abraham, in
the vault, are the remains of a ‘story’ of the ‘sacrifice of Isaac.’
In the upper part of the picture, on some rising and rocky ground,
Abraham is seen turned towards the right, and kneeling before an altar.
This figure is in large part almost obliterated, and the figure of
the angel who appears to him in the sky, and that of Isaac upon the
altar, can now scarcely be made out. On the right of the painting,
however, there may still be seen a tree boldly designed against the
sky, recalling certain passages in Alesso’s painting of the Nativity
in the atrium of the Annunziata at Florence. The lower part of this
lunette has entirely perished. ¶ In the lunette on the opposite wall,
below the figure of the patriarch, in the vault, is a ‘story’ of ‘Moses
receiving the tables of the Law on Mount Sinai.’ The upper portion of
this painting alone remains in a ruined condition. On the top of the
mount Moses kneels, turned to the left. The figure is much damaged;
and that of God the Father, who appears to him out of the heavens, has
almost entirely disappeared. The bare mountain-top is broken by patches
of herbage, and around it may still be seen some cypresses, with other
foliage. ¶ Below each of these lunettes, on the lateral walls of the
chapel, appear to have been two other stories; but the subject of only
one of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span> has been recorded (as I have said) by Vasari, namely, the
visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon, which appears to have been
on the left wall of the chapel. The story of Cain killing his brother
Abel, recorded by Cinelli, was probably on the altar-wall beside the
window, in the left-hand corner. ¶ In the figures on the vault, Alesso
attains to a nobility of design, and a largeness of manner, which he
does not again reach in any extant work of his. That extreme research
for form, which so largely spoils our enjoyment of the altar-piece
which he painted for this chapel, does not detract, at all in the same
degree, from the severe beauty of these figures; for they possess a
charm both of conception and design which is little distinctive of
Alesso’s later manner, though akin to a certain grace and sweetness
in some of his earliest works. The attitudes of these ‘prophets old’
are very grandly imagined, especially that of the David, who looks up
as he touches his psaltery with a gesture that expresses a spiritual
ecstasy, with an admirable fineness and reticence. Indeed, these
figures are represented with a truth of character, and a refinement of
feeling, for which we vainly look in similar works by his more famous,
and more obviously gifted, pupil, Domenico Ghirlandaio; such as the
vaults of the ‘Cappella Maggiore’ of Santa Maria Novella, and of the
Sassetti chapel in Santa Trinita. To judge from these figures of the
four patriarchs, the destruction of the ‘stories’ which were below
them cannot sufficiently be deplored; the reputation of few Florentine
masters depended so largely on a single work as Alesso’s did upon this
chapel of the Gianfigliazzi. ¶ One other fragment of the ‘stories’
which once decorated the walls of this chapel has come down to us.
Giuseppe Richa, in his ‘Notizie Istoriche delle Chiese Fiorentine,’
after mentioning the various portraits to be found in these paintings,
adds: ‘all these figures are named by the writers of the life of
Alesso; but they do not allude to [the portrait of] a young man in the
angle of the choir, on the epistle side, who is represented in a red
habit, with a green cap on his head, and a white handkerchief in his
hands; and this is Alesso Baldovinetti, who portrayed himself as he
was, when a young man; and he, also, drew there the portrait of Guido
Baldovinetti, who was the man most gifted and renowned at that time in
his illustrious family.’<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> ¶ Domenico Maria Manni, in the notes to
his edition of ‘Baldinucci,’ published a few years after Richa’s work
had appeared, cites a certain ‘Memoriale’ of Francesco di Giovanni
di Guido Baldovinetti, written in the year 1513. According to this
‘Memoriale’ (from which, no doubt, Richa derived his notice of the
portrait in question) Alesso portrayed on the walls of the ‘Cappella
Maggiore’ of Santa Trinita, among many other noble citizens, ‘Guido
Baldovinetti, and, last of all, himself, wearing a <i>cioppone</i> of
faded rose, and a handkerchief in his hand.’<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Among the pictures
which Morelli bequeathed to the Accademia Carrara, at Bergamo, is a
fragment of a fresco, No. 23, containing the head of a man. It has
been cut to a round measuring 0.23 centm. in diameter. According
to an inscription on the back of the painting it is a portrait of
Alesso Baldovinetti, painted by himself and taken from an angle of
the choir of Santa Trinita in Florence.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> There can be little doubt
that this is the head to which Francesco Baldovinetti referred in his
‘Memoriale,’ and that it was cut from the walls of Santa Trinita when
Alesso’s paintings were destroyed in 1760; but whether it is a portrait
of the painter is a question which I must not here attempt to discuss.</p>

collection of works of modern Dutch painters at the Guildhall is
much more representative than that of the old masters, and is likely
to be a revelation to those visitors who know only the few, and in
many cases inadequate, examples of modern Dutch works which have been
seen from time to time in London. In only one previous instance, that
of the Glasgow exhibition, has such a representative collection of
modern Dutch painters been brought together in this country. ¶ The
chief interest of the collection is to be found in the works of the
three brothers Maris and of Israels, for these painters are the leaders
of the school, and the rest, though not without individualities of
their own in technique and treatment, are followers. ¶ Joseph Israels
is represented at the Guildhall chiefly by works of his later period,
which are far better known in England than are the pictures in his
earlier manner, which can be studied best at Amsterdam; these latter
are distinguished by precision and detail rather than by the subtler
and more sympathetic treatment of his mature work. ¶ The largest
canvas of Israels shown is The Shipwrecked Fisherman (11), which,
though impressive and well balanced, has a certain stagey effect.
There are several tricks of technique, such as the parallel clouds
and sky, which, however, add not a little strength to the general
effect. Far superior to this picture is The Cottage Madonna (14), a
vigorous painting of a woman with a child in a characteristically Dutch
cottage interior. This fine work can hardly be considered a typical
example of Israels, not indeed because it falls short of his other
achievements, but rather for the opposite reason. It is a wonderful
piece of sympathetic painting, full of feeling and pathos, and without
those eccentricities which are apparent in such of his pictures as
A Jewish Wedding (95), interesting as being the last picture which
he has painted, and therefore reproduced here for this reason, but
lacking in the opinion of the present writer the surpassing merits
which many claim for it. It has become so much the mode to praise
equally all the work of a particular painter or a particular school,
that the sense of proportion and the power of discrimination have
almost become extinct and criticism has been undermined. No painter of
the modern Dutch school is more unequal than Israels, except perhaps
Mauve; and one feels that if he has almost risen to the level of a
great master in The Cottage Madonna, and perhaps in A Ray of Sunshine
(7) and The New Flower (82), there is a particular group of works
at the Guildhall which are sustained in estimation by the repute of
greater achievements. ¶ The case of Jacob Maris is quite otherwise. The
whole of his work is upon essentially legitimate lines, and inspires
a feeling that he never produced a picture from a less than worthy
motive. His pictures are full of the softness and delicacy of the Dutch
atmosphere, and most people would consider it incredible that none of
them were painted out-of-doors. Yet the present writer has been assured
by one of Maris’s intimate friends that this was the case; when a
particular view or picture struck him he was accustomed to stand with
his hands in his pockets, and the picture was painted entirely from
memory in his studio. Yet his works miss no essential truth. This stage
was not reached without much experimentalizing and profound study.
Jacob Maris began with a scrupulous striving after finish, which would
do credit to any of the little masters of Holland of the seventeenth
century. Take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span> for example The Weary Watchers (90), painted in 1869,
in which the child is painted with the finish of a Metzu, and the cat
approaching the cradle with the minuteness of a Mieris. It is a long
jump from this picture to A Windmill, Moonlight (125), the last work
which he finished; but under the surface of the latter, in spite of
the apparent dash, we perceive not one whit less regard for essential
truth. ¶ There are three or four canvases at the Guildhall which
display Maris in his very finest mood. Many will, perhaps, consider
that the finest of all, at least as regards brush work, is Gathering
Seaweed (44). The sky with its immense grey white clouds, through
breaks in which glimpses of blue beyond are discernible, is the chief
factor in the picture. This is in every respect one of Maris’s finest
works, and he has never exceeded the delicious silveriness of sea and
sky and the sense of moisture in the breeze which he here gives us; his
rendering of the wet flat sand on which stand the horse and cart of the
seaweed gatherers has been equalled only by Bonington. ¶ Of somewhat
similar character is the beautiful little Storm Cloud (80), into which
he has infused much the same feeling; but another phase of Maris is
shown in the wonderful Bridge (92), which deservedly occupies a place
of honour on the walls of the Guildhall gallery. Across a typical
Dutch canal is thrown a wooden bridge, under which, away along the
placid canal, can be seen a distant quay abutted with houses; little
red-tiled houses fill the extreme left and right of the picture. It is
a simple motive which in strict accordance with the principles of the
painters of Holland demonstrates the innate beauty of the commonplace.
Quite equal to this, both for intensity of feeling and realization, is
the River and Windmill (101) on the side wall; the sense of stillness
and calm which pervades this work is typical of the tranquillity of a
mind whose sole delight was in nature and its portrayal. The artist is
equally successful in a very different way in the bold and powerful
Dutch Town (43), which seems to be a freely adapted view of Amsterdam.
This is one of his latest works, and was painted in 1898. There is a
delicate shimmer on the water with its lazy craft, and the ill-defined
buildings are developed in an atmosphere shrouded by haze and darkened
by smoke. These two works should be compared with The Ferry Boat
(81), painted in 1870, which owes something to Van Goyen and Soloman
Ruysdael; to his appreciation of the qualities of his predecessors, and
his study of their art, Maris’s own achievements must in great measure
be attributed. It is always unsafe to prophesy, but it is almost safe
to say that Jacob Maris’s reputation will last. ¶ The representation at
the Guildhall of Willem Maris is much less worthy, and a better series
of his works could surely have been obtained; but in one small panel,
Springtime (37), we have the best qualities of his art, and it may be
doubted whether in the representation of the delicate and poetical
charm of spring Willem Maris is surpassed even by Daubigny, except in
a very few pictures. The trees awaken from their winter slumber and
put forth in velvety green the leaves which hardly more than tinge the
brownness of trunk and branch. The stream swollen with the recent rain
affords refreshing drink to the cattle which have just emerged from
the copse on the right. The meadow, with its carpet of tender green
bordered by a row of pollard willows, recedes until it meets the sky
line. Light clouds float over the blue sky and betoken weather fair
but fickle. ¶ When one turns from these two kindred spirits to their
brother Matthew Maris one is struck by the contrast. For Matthew lifts
us at once from things earthly into a spiritual atmosphere; everything
that he touches he envelops in mysticism and poetry. Yet perhaps his
work is more difficult of appreciation; he appeals to a more exclusive
circle. Yet what magic contour of line, what exquisite rhythm, what
consummate balance of composition, we find in it. The Outskirts of a
Town (39), for instance, enveloped in a bewitching gloom, commends itself to the
artist and student, though not to the lover of pyrotechnics. That
fine canvas entitled Montmartre (40) is another example of the same
idealistic treatment. Among examples of his work which particularly
puzzle the public are such efforts as A Study (58) and A Lady and Goats
(59), the latter an idyl inadequately described by its prosy title. But
perhaps the essence of his art is to be found in The Butterflies (62)
and L’Enfant Couchée (70), which for typical presentment and delicacy
of colour are among his finest achievements.</p>

<p>We are back once more upon the earth when we come to Anton Mauve, of whose works there are
no less than twenty-one examples in the Guildhall exhibition. With
the exception of Joseph Israels, he is the most unequal painter of
modern Holland; there are occasions when he comes near to equalling
Jacob Maris at least in atmospherical effect, and yet at other times
he sinks into a mere technical repetition of his better self. Of his
best phase we could not have better illustrations than The Hay Cart
(2) and Driving in the Dunes (4). In both there is the same feeling
for truth, the same adaptation of technique to the necessities of
the occasion. Watering Horses (97) is another fine work, resplendent
with harmonies of green and grey, and showing the same feeling for
natural phenomena. ¶ After such work as that of the brothers Maris,
and Mauve, and occasionally Israels, one is inevitably disappointed
with Mesdag. Mesdag misses the mark not because of any deficiencies
in technique, but because his works lack that essential quality of
landscape painting—atmosphere. The consequence is that we never lose
sight of the paint; it is paint everywhere. This is all the more to be
regretted since he is a good draughtsman, and his scheme of colour is
often satisfactory and truthful; moreover he has a profound knowledge
of composition. Yet with all these qualities he generally fails. We do
not want a sunset sky full of prismatic glow, nor a sea shimmering
with opalescent tints, if we cannot feel that it is a real sky and a
real sea, and that something other than paint fills up the intervening
space. Mesdag’s deficiency is emphasized in the two pictures shown in
the present exhibition, A Stormy Sunset (28) and A Threatening Sky
(54), which give us nothing but the mere physical features of the
scene, and leave us with an undefinable yearning for something for
which we look in vain. ¶ The other men whose work is represented for
the most part owe what is best in their art to the greater lights
of their school. Of such is the work of Théophile de Bock, of which
Evening (17) is an example of a plagiarism on the school of 1830,
intermingled with a Dutch sentiment which renders it difficult to say
with certainty whether it should be classified as French or Dutch in
sentiment. That Bock has originality when it is brought into play is
amply demonstrated in An Avenue in Holland (94). The sunlit road with
its strongly painted trees conveys an admirable idea of summer heat
and foliage, in which the artist boldly achieves his aim without any
aid but his own sheer force. Such a work shows powers which are never
brought into full play when he attempts to see with other eyes. Apart
from landscape there is but little of interest in the exhibition.
An exception, however, must be made in favour of the fine canvas
by Christopher Bisschop, Prayer Disturbed (29), which is a strong
and powerful piece of painting, and also intensely sympathetic in
realization. Two other canvases are worthy of mention, that by Albert
Neuhuys, Near the Cradle (96), a fine representation of a cottage
interior painted with incisive truth and directness, and Bosboom’s
Archives at Veere (128), an excellent example of the interiors to which
he devoted himself; it has the spaciousness and grace characteristic
of the work of a painter than whom no modern artist has shown a keener
appreciation of the artistic possibilities of ancient buildings.</p>

G. DES MAREZ, professor at the university and keeper of the
records of the city of Brussels, has drawn attention lately to three
seals which appeared to him to be worthy of special study. These
consist, first, of the matrix of the seal of the Gild of Barbers
in the fifteenth century, which forms part of the sigillographical
collection of the Musées Royaux du Cinquantenaire; secondly, of the
silver matrix of the seal of the Gild of Butchers in the sixteenth
century, preserved in the archives of the city of Brussels; thirdly
and lastly, of the matrix of the seal of the Gild of Bakers, in the
private collection of M. Charles Lefébure: this last belongs, like the
first, to the fifteenth century. Now the Brussels gilds were never
called upon to seal deeds, a fact of which M. Des Marez was the better
aware as he had just obtained a gold medal from the Royal Academy of
Belgium for an important study, which is at this moment in the press,
on the organization of labour in Brussels during the fifteenth century.
Were the three existing matrices therefore false? And, if they did
in reality date from the period to which everything contributed to
ascribe them, how was their presence to be explained? Those were the
questions which M. Des Marez set himself to adjudge and upon which he
has succeeded in throwing a brilliant light. ¶ Thanks to M. Des Marez’
kindness, I have been able to take cognizance of his work and of the
seals upon which it bears. M. Des Marez’ study will not be published
until the end of August or September next, when it will appear in the
annals of the Archaeological Society. My readers will therefore be the
first to find here set forth the solution of an important historical
and archaeological question. ¶ The juridical incompetence of the
Brussels trading corporations is indisputable. In the second half of
the thirteenth century, the artisans began to lay down the outlines
of a corporate movement. This led to a privilege obtained from Duke
John by the patricians invested with power, by which the craftsmen
were subjected to their authority. The gilds were dependent upon the
town council for all that concerned the making of their rules and
regulations; at most, they enjoyed the right of presenting drafts
for the approval and sanction of the aldermen; they were not able to
sell, pledge or mortgage; and, although their wardens were invested
with certain police functions, their jurisdiction was nevertheless
extremely limited. Difficult cases were submitted to the judgement of
the aldermen, and in no case could the wardens of their own initiative
proceed to a forced execution upon the persons or goods of delinquents.
¶ The gild was unable to issue any act directly, and therefore the
use of a seal, the attributive mark of jurisdiction, is inexplicable.
Even the Drapers’ Gild was without it, although this gild constituted
a powerful administrative and jurisdictive machinery by the side of
the aldermen, of whom, at the time of its splendour, it was even
independent. It issued acts, which the trading corporations were not
able to do, and made regulations, far and near, for all those having
to do with the woollen manufactures or cloth-making. The absence of a
collective seal is to be explained, in this case, by the use made by
the deacons of their personal seals, a use proved by documents in which
it is explicitly mentioned. It was not until 1698 that the Drapers’
Gild ordered a collective seal to be made. The matrix of this seal is
lost, but there remains an impression of it affixed to one side of the
very sheet containing the text of the resolution relating to it, which
document is preserved in the archives of the kingdom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span> where I have
been able to consult it. ¶ The engraving of this seal is very poor. In
a circular field is St. Michael, clad in a Roman breast-plate, his legs
cased in buskins. His forehead is surmounted by a cross, and his wings
are unfolded. He brandishes a sword in his right hand. Lucifer lies
felled at his feet. St. Michael is seizing one of the demon’s horns
with his hand. Lucifer raises his right hand with a defending gesture;
his left arm is brought back against his body. He wears short wings,
one of which covers a part of the saint’s arm. His lower limbs end in
claws; a long tail is twined between his legs. The impression is made
on a paper pulp which was previously moistened. Above this was laid a
cut-out leaf of thin paper, on which the matrix of the seal was pressed
with force. The paper shows stains of mould; the reliefs are weak and
difficult to distinguish; to reproduce them by photography is almost
impossible. These circumstances, added to the fact that this piece has
absolutely no artistic value, account for the absence of a reproduction
in these pages. Between the two circular fillets that run around the
above figures is this inscription: SIGIL · DECANOR · ET OCTOJUDICUM
· GILDÆ · BRUXELLENSIS. (<i>Sigillum decanorum et octojudicium gildæ
bruxellensis.</i>) The text of the resolution says that the seal shall
be inscribed with the words: <i>Sigillum collegii decanorum</i>, etc.
The engraver could not find room for the word <i>collegii</i>, and
was obliged to omit it. This is why a note added to the text of the
resolution of December 4, ordering the execution of the seal, declares
that a true impression of the seal is affixed on the other side and
corrects the text by suppressing the word <i>collegii</i>. I may also
mention that, whereas the seal shows the spelling GILDÆ, the text
preserves the old mediaeval spelling GILDE. ¶ We find, therefore,
that one alone of the corporations, the Drapers’ Gild, which was the
most powerful, did unquestionably possess a seal, but at a late date,
at the end of the seventeenth century. This innovation is due, on
the one hand, to modifications introduced into the expedition of the
acts, involving the abolition of the single or double parchment label
separate from the sheet itself and bearing the seal; on the other, to
the fact that the deacons abandoned the use of their personal seals,
which served as a signature in the middle ages, for the customary
employment of a manuscript signature. The personal seals of the
deacons having been abandoned, it became necessary to have recourse
to a collective seal. ¶ It is certain, therefore, that the juridical
conditions under which the trading corporations were constituted give
rise to very grave doubts as to the authenticity of the seals of the
gilds. If we add the fact that the records contain no sealed document
proceeding from any of the Brussels gilds, we shall feel greatly
tempted to lend to these doubts the force of certainty. However, an
examination of the three matrices of seals which are here for the first
time reproduced scarcely permits us to believe in their falseness. Let
me briefly analyse each of these three pieces.</p>

<div class="figright illowe12" id="i_191">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_191.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption">SEAL OF THE GILD OF BARBERS</div>
</div>

<p>The matrix of the seal of the Barbers’ Gild is in the sigillographical
collection of the Musées Royaux du Cinquantenaire. Two figures are
standing on a circular ground; they represent St. Cosmas and St.
Damian, the patrons of barber-surgeons. They are dressed in the costume
of the fifteenth century. The right figure, clad in a tunic that comes
down to mid-leg, carries in its left hand a mortar exactly similar to
the mortars that were still in use in Flanders in the last century. In
its right hand, it holds an instrument that might be either a pestle
or a lancet; it is a long, thin instrument, spreading slightly at one
end. Its right arm is bent, and from the wrist hangs a sort of case
shaped like a purse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span> with an open clasp. This figure symbolizes the
barber. By its side is a shield bearing a pair of open scissors, with
an instrument in pale that appears identical with that which the figure
holds in its right hand. The figure on the left is clad in a long
robe adorned with a wide collar, which seems to point to a profession
superior to that of the mere barber: this is a surgeon. In his right
hand, he holds a round phial with a long, bell-mouthed neck. His left
hand is folded over his breast; the extended fore-finger points to
the phial. From his wrist hangs a bag or purse-shaped case, with open
clasp. By his side is the escutcheon of the city of Brussels, which,
in the fifteenth century, was a plain red shield. The two figures are
standing on a grassy mound. In the upper half of the circumference of
the seal we see a device that reads: <i>S. barbitonsorū in brūx</i>.
This seal is the only one of the three that bears a Latin device, a
fact quite in keeping with the learned profession of the surgeons and
barbers.</p>

<div class="figleft illowe12" id="i_192a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_192a.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption">SEAL OF THE GILD OF BAKERS</div>
</div>

<p>The matrix of the seal of the Bakers’ Gild is now in the private
collection of M. Charles Lefébure. On the ground of the seal we see
St. Aubert, Bishop of Cambrai, the patron of the Brussels bakers, clad
in his pontifical vestments, with the mitre on his head. With his
right hand he is giving the benediction; in his left he holds a peel,
the shovel used for thrusting bread into the oven. The figure rises
at half-length from behind a wide shield on which are represented,
saltierwise, a peel, with two round loaves laid upon the blade, and a
bar for raking the cinders. The circular inscription is in Flemish, it
reads: <i>S. d’s ambachts · der · beckers · in brussel ·</i> (‘Seal
of the Gild of the Bakers in Brussels’). The seal displays all the
characteristics of the fifteenth century.</p>

<div class="figright illowe12" id="i_192b">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_192b.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption">SEAL OF THE GILD OF BUTCHERS.</div>
</div>

<p>The matrix of the seal of the Butchers’ Gild is in silver. It is kept
in the archives of the city of Brussels. Its date must be carried
back to the early sixteenth century; it is very beautifully engraved.
St. Michael fells the dragon, represented as a shaggy monster with a
bull’s head, which seizes the saint’s left leg in one of its claws;
in the other, it clutches the escutcheon, which it bites in the lower
corner. The saint is clad in armour. In his right hand, he brandishes
his sword; with his left, he holds the escutcheon, which he uses as
a buckler. On the shield figure the heads of three animals: an ox,
a calf and a sheep. The exergue bears the device in Flemish: <span class="smaller">S.
TSVLEESHOUWERS · A͡BACHT · IN BRUESSEL ·</span> (‘Seal of the Butchers’
Gild in Brussels’). ¶ M. Des Marez connects the making of these seals
with the great impulse towards emancipation that stirred the trading
corporations in the fifteenth century. In the second half of that
century, the protests of the magistrates are constantly multiplying,
and the trades seem to be progressing towards complete independence. On
the accession of Mary of Burgundy, a violent popular agitation wrested
from the young princess the privilege of June 4, 1477, which hallowed
the triumph of democracy. But this victory lasted only a little while;
and, in 1480, Maximilian of Austria restored the old constitution of
1421. The execution of the seals must, therefore, be ascribed to this
emancipatory movement and, doubtless, to that short period of three
years during which the gilds, as sovereign masters, were called upon to
seal their acts. It is to be presumed that, if any acts were sealed,
these were very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span> rare and were probably destroyed; and it is also very
possible that, after the matrices had been engraved, the reaction set
in almost immediately and that they were never used. ¶ This concerns
the seals of the Barbers’ and Bakers’ Gilds. That of the butchers must
be attributed to the beginning of the sixteenth century. The gild had,
since 1450, claimed a privileged situation consecrating the hereditary
principle: none could be a butcher who was not sprung from butchers.
This privilege, granted by Philip the Good, kindled a quarrel between
the butchers and the town which sometimes led to bloodshed and which
lasted for seventy years. In or about 1516, Charles V put an end to
this state of things by perpetuating the privilege. The date of the
execution of the seal corresponds with this victory for the gild.
But the butchers were stopped in their too independent courses and
were made to continue to recognize the authority of the town council
in all that concerned the making of their rules and regulations and
the management of their interests. ¶ I have shown how constitutional
history and sigillography have together enabled M. Des Marez to solve
a question debated to this day by proving the genuineness of the seals
of the Brussels gilds. The question involved a two-fold problem,
historical and archaeological. The interest attaching to it will be
understood when I add that seals of gilds are exceedingly rare in
Belgium. Hardly any are known to exist except for Bruges, Saint-Trond,
Hasselt, Maastricht, Liége and Ardenbourg. Almost all the tradesmen
were subject to the authority of the town magistrates. The seals of the
Brussels gilds survive as eloquent witnesses of a temporary triumph in
their struggle for independence.</p>

Exhibition of British engraving which has been arranged at the
Victoria and Albert Museum is of considerable interest and importance.
Moreover, it is timely; for the trend of fashion in engravings has of
late been in a direction so limited, that the need was very apparent of
a corrective to a popular point of view by no means entirely warranted
by the facts. The cult of the colour-print and mezzotint has been
pursued beyond all reasonable bounds. In the hands of able merchants
and indiscriminating patrons it has reached a mere absurdity—expressed
in market values. The whole matter has got out of scale; and the
most serious criticism that could be launched against the present
exhibition—that it tried to cover a field too wide—is fully met by
the absolute desirability of reminding the British public that there
were line engravings of some importance; that aquatint had been used
with results of no little value; that etching was not a lost art, and
that mezzotints of subjects other than those devoted to portraits of
pretty women were by no means ignoble. ¶ The art of line engraving
was but tardily settled in this country, for some doubtful reason,
not until well-nigh a century after it had reached a pitch of high
perfection on the continent. Its tangible beginnings are represented
at South Kensington by the superb title-page of the ‘Anatomy’ of
Thomas Gemini (1545). But the work of William Rogers is the first
of importance by a native-born artist. By him, we have the superb
portrait of Queen Elizabeth, lent by his Majesty the King from the
collection at Windsor; and three plates from Segar’s ‘Honor Military
and Ciuill,’ Sir Thomas Docwra, Godfreydus Adelmar, and Alphonsus
Rex Castiliensis. These very fairly represent the strongly individual
talent of Rogers, who used a most expressive line with care and
economy; and in his employment of the dot for the modelling of faces,
foreshadowed the invention of stipple by more than a hundred years.
¶ The method of Thomas Coxon is not represented in the exhibition;
but that of Elstracke, a Flemish contemporary has full justice done
to it by the fine Prince Charles, as well as other prints from the
King’s collection. His Majesty has also contributed most of the best
examples of the severe and dry manner of the De Passe family, who had
an influence so great on British line engraving; but whose technique,
however able, seems to lack something, and to have destroyed the
decorative qualities which were already apparent in the earlier group.
An interesting comparison may be made between the Queen Elizabeth of
Crispin de Passe and that of Rogers mentioned before. Of the engravers
of the later part of the seventeenth century, mention need only be
made of the fact that Faithorne the elder, David Loggan, Sherwin, and
White, all receive ample justice in the exhibition; and this means that
under their names will be found some of the finest prints exhibited in
any branch of engraving. The line engraving of the eighteenth century
developed for the best in subjects other than portraiture. Thus we have
the strong work of that turbulent spirit, Sir Robert Strange, devoted
mainly to the translation of paintings by the great masters; and that
of William Woollett and his school to landscape, especially after
Claude. Woollett is well represented by four plates attributed entirely
to him, and by two in which Ellis and Vivares avowedly collaborated.
But of the first it must be said that a note in Dance’s ‘Portraits’
expressly states that Thomas Hearne, the water-colour artist, who was
apprenticed to Woollett, ‘etched’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
the Roman Edifices in Ruins. The working proof exhibited at Kensington
(No. 146) is, if this is true, in great part the work of Hearne. We
have little space on this occasion for more than the merest summary of
the contents of the gallery; an adequate notice of which would indeed
require at least a whole number of this magazine. It is only possible
therefore, in passing from the subject of line engraving, to draw
special attention to Mr. Rawlinson’s splendid loan of specimens of the
fine school fostered especially by J. M. W. Turner; to the numerous
proofs of the delicate work produced by the book illustrators of about
the same period; and to the interesting and unique examples of working
and finished proofs of the Landseer school—portions of a collection
which came to the National Art Library by the generosity of Mr.
Sheepshanks—in its way, probably unrivalled.</p>

<p>There is little to say, in this place, on the subject of the mezzotints. His Majesty has lent
a magnificent impression of The Great Executioner, by Prince Rupert,
after Spagnoletto; a print which strikes one as perhaps in its vigour
and splendid painter-like qualities the finest in the gallery. The rest
of the mezzotints are generally well known, though to the credit of the
exhibition it must be said that the preponderance of the fashionable,
if insipid class, is not overwhelming. The Wards are hardly as good as
they might be; especially in view of the large amount of space given
to Charles Turner. But The Water Mill by the latter, after Sir A. W.
Callcott, makes one very charitable towards him. It is certainly one of
the finest examples of the value of mezzotint as a method of rendering
landscape. Mr. Rawlinson, again, lends some valuable examples of the
‘Liber Studiorum’ which are carefully and instructively catalogued.
Among the modern work, that of Mr. Frank Short holds, of course, the
first place, for he is one of the very few living mezzotinters who
can be said to take rank with the best of the old men in technique.
The pretty art of stipple receives due attention; and so do the
colour-prints, of which the best are, it is good to find, the property
of the museum. The art of etching is well shown from Hollar, the group
of imitators of Rembrandt in the eighteenth century, the Norwich
school, and Wilkie and Geddes in the nineteenth, down to the etching
clubs and our own times. Most of this work is well known, for etching
has been better served in the matter of literature than any of its
sister arts: and it is the only one which has real life at the present
day. A most important complement to the exhibited prints is furnished
by a series of technical cases, containing complete sets of all tools
and materials used in each of the various methods of engraving and
etching; as well as examples of all the intermediate stages of working
them. These were arranged by Mr. Frank Short and Miss C. M. Pott, and
their descriptive notes in the catalogue make it a really useful little
manual of technique for the amateur. It only remains to add that the
illustration of Rogers’s Queen Elizabeth is reproduced by the gracious
permission of his Majesty the King, who has also allowed a photogravure
to be made of The Great Executioner, by Prince Rupert, which will
appear as a supplement to the next number of T<span class="smaller">HE</span>

<p>Among the additions to the department of British and mediaeval
antiquities during the past half year are several objects of
exceptional interest. In the ceramic section, a large two-handled
vase of Florentine maiolica of the fifteenth century, with heraldic
lions upon the sides, forms a worthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span> pendant to the magnificent vase
of the same fabric acquired last year; while the series of oriental
wares has been enriched by a writing-stand, or stand for flowers, of
the twelfth or thirteenth century, ornamented with animals of archaic
style in relief, and attributed to a factory in the neighbourhood
of Aleppo. The acquisitions to the collection of glass exhibited in
the same room include an enamelled German drinking-glass of the late
sixteenth century, a very good example of its kind. ¶ In the mediaeval
room the most notable additions will be found in the series of ivory
carvings. Here the place of honour belongs to the beautiful head of a
tau cross in morse ivory, dating from the eleventh century, recently
discovered in the vicarage garden of Alcester, Warwickshire, which
will be fully described next month in these pages. Secondly, there
is a small but important group of ivories formerly in the possession
of the Rev. Walter Sneyd, of Keele Hall, and exhibited in the art
treasures exhibition at Manchester in 1857, and at South Kensington
in 1862. Although few of the pieces composing this group are of high
artistic merit, they are valuable as illustrations of the development
of ivory carving during the early middle ages, a period which needed
fuller representation in the museum collections. The most remarkable
is an oval pyx of the form favoured between the fourth and seventh
centuries, especially in Egypt and Syria. Its interest lies in the fact
that it appears to be a Carlovingian imitation of a Syrian original
dating from perhaps two centuries earlier. It differs essentially in
style from the other examples which have been preserved, and the heavy,
large-headed figures, with their long, retorted fingers, find their
nearest parallels in the miniatures of Carlovingian MSS. Then there is
a Byzantine panel, apparently by the same hand as a plaque acquired by
the museum at the Ashburnham sale in 1901. This plaque was let into
the cover of a thirteenth-century MS. of the romance of ‘Parceval le
Galois,’ but originally belonged to a casket ornamented with scenes
from the history of Joseph, two large panels from which have been for
many years in the Berlin museum. It is satisfactory now to record the
acquisition from the Sneyd collection of yet another example marked by
the same individuality of style, and perhaps once forming a part of the
same composition. Another small piece of Byzantine work not without
charm is a panel from the lid of a casket of the ninth century, with
figures probably from one of the classical scenes so popular during
the iconoclastic period. Finally there are two long panels with seated
apostles, Rhenish work of the twelfth century, and a smaller panel
with the Flagellation, of similar attribution and date. An interesting
accession in the sphere of prehistoric industrial art is a remarkably
large bronze spear-head, inlaid at the base of the blade with gold
studs, a fine example of the skill and taste of the metal-workers of
Britain towards the close of the bronze age.</p>

<p>The Department has acquired by purchase an extremely interesting and
important addition to the collection of Chinese paintings. This is
a long roll, containing scenes of court life and amusements in the
first century <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> Pan Chao, a female historian of that era,
is among the figures represented. It is painted in colours on brown
silk; green, purple, and a tawny yellow have been used, but have more
or less sunk, so that the general impression is that of a painting
in vermilion and black, the two pigments which have stood best. The
actual workmanship, especially the modulation of the brush-line, is of
extraordinary beauty and power, and can only be that of a great master.
There seems no reason to doubt that we have in this roll an authentic
work by Ku K‘ai-chih (‘Ko-gai-shi’ in Japanese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
pronunciation), a very famous artist of the fourth and fifth centuries
<span class="smaller">A.D.</span>, to whom it has always been attributed, though the
signature and inscriptions are probably of later date. Annexed to
the roll is a eulogy of the painter in the handwriting of Ch‘ien
Lung, the emperor who received Lord Macartney’s embassy in 1793;
and following this is an admirable and delicate ink-landscape by
an eighteenth-century painter. The importance of a picture by Ku
K‘ai-chih will be realized when we consider that of the art of the
T‘ang dynasty (600 to 900 <span class="smaller">A.D.</span>) hardly a vestige remains,
while relics of the later Sung period are extremely rare. Nothing so
ancient exists in Japan, the country where for a thousand years the
early paintings of China have been collected with ardour and preserved
with veneration. ¶ A full account of this and some other important
examples of Chinese painting will shortly be given in this magazine.</p>

<p class="right mright2">L. B.</p>

<h3 id="Life_of_Bernard_van_Orley">NOTE ON THE LIFE OF BERNARD VAN ORLEY</h3>

<p>Bernard van Orley is generally said to have been the second son—third
child—of Valentine van Orley by his first wife, Margaret van
Pynbroeck, whom he married May 13, 1490. He is further stated to have
left Brussels in 1509 for Rome, and to have studied in the school
of Raphael, becoming a great favourite with his master. ¶ It seems
impossible to reconcile these statements with certain facts which are
established beyond doubt by authentic documents. In 1514 Bernard was
settled as a master-painter at Brussels, and had already gained a
certain reputation, for the confraternity of the Holy Cross at Furnes
in 1515 sent a delegate to Brussels to ask him to furnish a design for
the altar-piece of their chapel. Bernard must therefore have at that
time attained the age of 30,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> which would put back the date of his
birth to 1484–5. And unless there is some error in the date—May 4,
1504—of the procuration published by A. Wauters (‘Bernard van Orley,’
Bruxelles, 1881, p. 70), his birth must have taken place before May
1479, as no minor could give a procuration or power of attorney to
another to dispose of property. Children at that time only attained
their majority at the age of 25. ¶ If born in 1479 Bernard may well
have become a free master or gone to Rome in 1509. I suspect that he
was not the son of Valentine and Margaret van Pynbroeck, but of some
other Valentine, perhaps the uncle. I know of no document giving the
name of his mother.</p>

almost every corner of these islands there is to be found hidden
away amongst the trees or proudly standing on the summit of a hill one
of those imposing ancestral homesteads which the British aristocracy
have erected at various times ever since the Norman conquest. From the
feudal castle of gothic architecture to the modern mansion replete
with every comfort and household invention of the nineteenth century
every style is represented. These buildings are geographical landmarks
in the country, and nearly all are also landmarks in the artistic
topography of Great Britain. Succeeding generations of owners have
accumulated treasures which, severely guarded by family settlements,
can only be dislodged under special conditions. In not a few instances
the ancient furniture thus preserved, the objects of art and especially
the pictures, the latter usually grouped round a nucleus of family
portraits of successive periods, would rival many a public collection
for the perfection of the examples, their artistic and monetary worth,
and even their actual number. The more therefore is it to be regretted
that they are so rarely accessible to the artist, the student, the
public at large. A small percentage is, it is true, to be seen at the
admirable loan exhibitions organized yearly at Burlington House and the
Guildhall, and also from time to time in galleries governed by private
enterprise; but these artistic feasts are all too rare, and even were
the owners of fine works of art always willing to lend their property,
which is not invariably the case, it would be impossible for all the
objects worthy of being shown to pass in this way before the gaze of
a single generation. Many are the masterpieces in this country which
have not moved from their resting place for scores of years and which
are, except to a privileged few, as completely unknown and invisible
as the immensely distant stars which astronomers contemplate through
their most powerful lens. ¶ The collection of pictures at Somerley,
the Earl of Normanton’s beautiful seat near Ringwood in Hampshire, is
one of those of whose very existence only a small minority is aware.
The mansion, of late Georgian style, stands on the banks of the Avon
in the midst of a park and estate extending over 9,000 acres, and
is visited by only a small number of persons annually besides Lord
Normanton’s immediate entourage. ¶ With a very few exceptions, the
entire collection was formed between the years 1820 and 1868 by Welbore
Ellis, second Earl of Normanton, and grandfather of the present peer.
Born in 1778, he succeeded to the title in 1809, married Diana, eldest
daughter of the eleventh Earl of Pembroke, in 1816, and died in his
ninetieth year in 1868, leaving as a record of his taste and artistic
knowledge the wonderful gallery of paintings which is the subject
of this study. ¶ The collection is composed chiefly of pictures of
the eighteenth-century English school, including works by Reynolds,
Gainsborough, Hogarth, Hoppner, Romney, Lawrence, Morland, Bonington,
Nasmyth and Crome; it contains also pictures by some Flemish and Dutch
masters of the seventeenth century, Rubens, Van Dyck and Teniers,
Paul Potter, Van de Capelle, Aart van der Neer, Wouwerman and Willem
van de Velde; Guardi and Canaletto represent the Italian; Murillo
represents the Spanish school; whilst Greuze is the only French artist
who has found a place at Somerley. The most striking feature of the
collection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
is to be found in the predominance of works by Sir Joshua Reynolds,
evidently the favourite painter of the second Lord Normanton, who
acquired no fewer than twenty-six examples from his brush. ¶ For the
sake of clearness and convenience, a description of the Normanton
collection may be divided into three sections, namely:—</p>

  JOSHUA REYNOLDS FOR THE WINDOW AT NEW COLLEGE, OXFORD; IN THE COLLECTION OF
  THE EARL OF NORMANTON</div>

</div>

<p>¶ The group of paintings by Sir Joshua Reynolds is unparalleled in any
other collection public or private all the world over; both by the
number and the excellence of the examples, it is absolutely unique,
and it would be well-nigh impossible at the present day for even a
multi-millionaire to bring together a rival gathering of this one
painter’s productions. ¶ All through his career as a collector, Lord
Normanton continued to acquire examples of Sir Joshua’s work, but his
most important single purchase was made as early as 1821 at the sale
of the pictures of the Marchioness of Thomond, held at Christie’s on
May 18 and 19 of that year. The Marchioness of Thomond was no other
than Mary Palmer, daughter of Sir Joshua’s elder sister, and sister to
pretty ‘Offy’ Palmer, afterwards Mrs. Gwatkin, whom her uncle so often
used as a model for his fancy pictures, notably for the Strawberry
Girl. When Sir Joshua died in 1792, he left the bulk of his property to
his niece, Mary Palmer; she inherited nearly £100,000 besides a number
of pictures and other works of art; the same year she married the fifth
Earl of Inchiquin, subsequently created Marquess of Thomond. After her
death in 1821, her pictures were sold at Christie’s, and that occasion
may be said to mark the foundation of the Normanton collection. Lady
Thomond’s sale included, besides many works by old masters, a large
number of pictures and sketches by her illustrious uncle; and here
Lord Normanton secured for less than £3,000 the wonderful series of
seven decorative panels which have ever remained the chief ornament of
his collection, and for which in recent years fabulous sums have been
offered and refused. They represent the three theological virtues,
Faith, Hope, and Charity, and the four cardinal virtues, Temperance,
Prudence, Justice, and Fortitude. They are the original designs
executed by Sir Joshua Reynolds for the window at New College, Oxford,
and afterwards copied on glass by Jarvis. Ever since his school days
at Westminster, Lord Normanton had known and admired these pictures at
Lady Thomond’s. On the day of the sale, in answer to a suggestion of
the auctioneer that the entire set should be sold together, the company
present, which included the Dukes of Devonshire and Northumberland,
Lords Egremont, Grosvenor, Bridgewater, Fitzwilliam, Dudley and
Ward, and Harewood, Sir Charles Long on behalf of the king, and many
other well-known picture buyers, decided that the Virtues should be
offered separately. The Charity was put up first, and its purchase at
1,100 guineas by Lord Normanton, then a young man, created no small
sensation. Lord Dudley and Ward eagerly competed for the Fortitude, for
which his mother had sat to Sir Joshua, but that as well as the other
six succumbed to Lord Normanton’s bidding. Seven years later an offer
of twice the purchase price was made for them on behalf of the king,
and again some few years afterwards the National Gallery tried in vain
to tempt Lord Normanton with three times the original sum. ¶ As to the
designs themselves, it had been the painter’s original intention to
make them drawings or cartoons; but he soon found it would be easier
for him to paint them in oils, so long had he been used to the brush
and the palette. ‘Jarvis, the painter on glass,’ he said, ‘will have a
better original to copy, and I suppose persons hereafter may be found
to purchase my paintings.’ In this he was, however, disappointed,
since the Virtues were still in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span> his possession at his death. ¶In a
letter written about 1778, Sir Joshua details the general plan for
the Oxford window. ‘Supposing this scheme to take place, my idea is
to paint, in the great space in the centre, Christ in the Manger, on
the principle that Correggio has done it, in the famous picture called
the Notte; making all the light proceed from Christ. These tricks of
the art, as they may be called, seem to be more properly adapted to
glass-painting than any other kind. This middle space will be filled
with the Virgin, Christ, Joseph and angels; the two smaller spaces
on each side I shall fill with the shepherds coming to worship; and
the seven divisions below with the figures of Faith, Hope, Charity
and the four cardinal virtues; which will make a proper rustic base
or <i>foundation</i> for the support of the Christian Religion....’
¶ The large central picture of the Nativity, measuring ten feet by
eighteen, was sold by the artist to the Duke of Rutland for the then
unprecedented price of 1,200 guineas. It was unfortunately destroyed
in the fire at Belvoir in 1816. A powerful sketch of this subject on a
small scale is, however, to be found at Somerley. ¶ The seven Virtues,
which now hang side by side in the magnificent gallery built by the
second Earl of Normanton, each measure 6 ft. 11 in. in height by 2
ft. 9 in. in width, except the central panel, Faith, which is taller
and narrower than the others, namely, 8 ft. by 2 ft. 5 in. Charity
is represented by a group of a woman clasping three children in her
protecting arms, whilst all the rest contain but a single allegorical
figure, with the special attributes consecrated by tradition. The most
noteworthy feature of the entire series, and that which first strikes
the onlooker, is its thoroughly and unmistakably English character. No
straining after classicism, no copying or imitation of the Italians
are to be found in this the most successful work of decoration ever
painted by a British artist. In the Nativity, Reynolds was accused of
a too servile imitation of Correggio, but certainly no such reproach
can apply to the seven Virtues. In the conception or the execution,
in the drawing or the colour, in the types of his models or the
arrangement of the draperies, nowhere is a trace discernible of any
foreign element. Reynolds represented the Virtues under the features of
the lovely and refined English ladies whom he was accustomed to paint;
the draperies in which they are clothed are dresses of the eighteenth
century, simplified no doubt, and chastened, but sometimes scarcely
altered, as in the case of Temperance and Prudence. He thus avoided
the cold conventionality usually so apparent in allegorical paintings,
whilst losing nothing in dignity or impressiveness; if one misses the
spiritual elevation of the Italians, there is a corresponding gain in
humanity, and that indefinable quality, charm.</p>

</div>

<p>Faith is represented by the figure of a girl with a face of exquisite innocence and
sweetness, expressive also of deep suffering and infinite resignation.
Her plain white pilgrim’s robe is partly covered by a loose brown
drapery falling around her in simple heavy folds; with her left hand
she holds a tall wooden cross, the upper part of which is strongly
outlined against the divine illumination which brightens the clouds
above her; her right hand is uplifted towards heaven in an attitude of
invocation. Hope is the least successful panel of the series. Clad in
dull green draperies with a brown scarf flowing from her shoulders,
she stands in a somewhat awkward position, her hands uplifted and her
face averted towards the light which pours upon her through the clouds.
Charity can, on the contrary, rank with the finest of Sir Joshua’s
pictures; his model in this instance was Mrs. Sheridan, the lovely
wife of the author of ‘School for Scandal,’ who had also sat to him
for the figure of the Virgin in the Nativity. On her breast nestles a
half-naked infant whom she lovingly supports with her left hand, whilst
with the other she clasps in a close embrace two more children, a young
girl and a curly-headed boy, who have run to her for protection; with
an expression of rare tenderness and pity she gazes down upon her
little charges. This picture is painted with exceptional power; the
contrasts of light and shade are rendered with a perfection almost
reminiscent of Rembrandt, whilst the composition is both strong
and graceful. The two beautiful young women in whom Reynolds has
impersonated Temperance and Prudence are clothed in white dresses of
eighteenth-century design, bordered in the case of the second with a
narrow gold braid. Mrs. Elizabeth Palmer, wife of the artist’s nephew,
the Dean of Cashel, was the model for Prudence; she gazes thoughtfully
into a mirror which she holds in her right hand; in the left she has
an arrow round which an adder is entwined. Temperance is pouring
water from a golden jug into a golden cup. In the two last panels,
the figures stand full face to the spectator; the features of Justice
are shaded by the balance which she raises to the level of her head;
her loose robe, held by a girdle at the waist, is rose-coloured, and
her right hand rests on the hilt of a naked sword. Fortitude (Lady
Dudley and Ward) is the traditional figure of Britannia, a plumed
helmet upon her noble head, a small golden breast-plate decorating
her white robe, around which a dark red mantle is draped; the head of
the watchful lion crouching at her feet is shown in the right-hand
corner. ¶ Several other works by Sir Joshua were acquired by Lord
Normanton besides the seven Virtues at Lady Thomond’s sale, including
the expressive half-length portrait of himself, painted in 1769, in
his robes of president of the Royal Academy, his right hand resting
on a book. The delightful portrait of Elizabeth, daughter of Sir
Joshua’s friend Topham Beauclerk and his beautiful wife Lady Diana,
represented as Spenser’s Una with the lion crouching at her side, came
from the same source and cost only thirty-seven guineas. Elizabeth
Beauclerk married in 1787 the Earl of Pembroke and was the mother of
Diana, Lady Normanton, wife of the collector. Sir Joshua painted
her about the year 1778 and showed her in a perfectly simple white
frock, childishly sitting on her heels upon the ground. Her hair falls
loosely over her shoulders and her expression is one of thoughtful
innocence. The foliage and landscape behind her are treated with great
breadth and power; the more delicate parts of the picture, such as
the face and hands, are on the contrary very smoothly painted; the
marked difference in texture is explained by the fact that at this
period Sir Joshua used a mixture of wax and Venice turpentine as a
vehicle for the heads, and wax alone for other portions of his pictures
where he wished to produce thicker impastos. The picture described
in Lady Thomond’s catalogue as A Girl seated on her heels embracing
a favourite Kitten, for which Lord Normanton gave 295 guineas, is
one of several of the same delightful subject done by Sir Joshua and
usually known as Felina. It was painted in 1787, and although Offy
Palmer was by that time a grown-up young woman, it is her features
when a child which her uncle has once more used. Witty and graceful,
this picture bears witness to Sir Joshua’s supremacy as a limner of
children. No one more than he succeeded in reproducing their quaint and
charmingly awkward attitudes, and it would be difficult to find even
in his works anything more delicious than this little dark-eyed damsel
fondling her unhappy pet almost to the point of suffocation. The face
is painted with great delicacy and a clearness of complexion unusual
in Sir Joshua’s pictures; the background of foliage is unfortunately
severely cracked, owing to an excessive use of treacherous bitumen.
Miss Falconer (afterwards the Hon. Mrs. Stanhope) as Contemplation
was also included in the Marchioness of Thomond’s collection, but was
not bought at her sale by Lord Normanton. It was knocked down on that
occasion for 100 guineas to a dealer, from whom it passed into the
possession of Mr. John Allnutt, of Clapham Common, and it was only many
years later that it was transferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span> into the Somerley collection of
which it now forms part. The beautiful lady whom the painter has here
represented, in a moonlit landscape, seated on a bank in a pensive
attitude, was a well-known figure in the society of her day, where her
high spirits and light-hearted gaiety made her a general favourite;
the appearance of this portrait, so contrary to her character, excited
no little comment at the time. In charm of expression and unaffected
grace of pose this portrait is a truly delightful production. An
interesting fact concerning it is that it is one of the few portraits
by Reynolds painted on a panel; the artist, who, as is well known,
was for ever making new experiments in the mediums he employed,
selected on this occasion an old Japanese panel, and the reverse
of the picture is to this day decorated with a still-life in bold
relief, brilliant in colouring and of no mean artistic merit. ¶ In
three life-size full-length portraits of young girls which hang in
Lord Normanton’s gallery, it is instructive to compare the artist’s
method of treatment of a similar subject at different periods of his
career. These pictures are those of Lady Betty Hamilton, painted in
1758, of Miss Murray of Kirkcudbright, 1765, and that, some twenty
years later in date, known for lack of a better title as The Little
Gardener. In the first there is a richness of colour and a wealth of
detail not to be found in either of the two others; the influence
of Reynolds’s master, Hudson, is still clearly discernible, and the
warmth and brilliance of the colouring must be traced to the immediate
effects of the artist’s recent travels in Italy, where the gorgeous
tones of the Venetians had filled him with a boundless admiration. In
the two earlier portraits there is a simple artlessness of pose in
striking contrast with the affected and self-conscious attitude of The
Little Gardener, whilst the latter is far broader and more spontaneous
in technique. ¶ The portrait of Lady Betty Hamilton, afterwards
Countess of Derby, is unsurpassed by any work of Sir Joshua at this
early period, and it may also be counted among the best of his child
portraits. In a low-cut dress of plum-coloured embroidered silk, her
wide skirt reaching to the ground, she sits on a bank in a garden; she
has a white muslin pinafore bordered with lace, and her hands rest on
her lap holding a bunch of vari-coloured flowers. The flesh-tints are
somewhat faded, but the dreamy blue eyes and rosebud mouth expressive
of happy childhood’s ignorance of evil and suffering, are a delight
to look upon. She was a daughter of the Duke of Hamilton, and became
the first wife of the twelfth Earl of Derby, who, after divorcing her,
married Miss Farren the celebrated actress. In 1777 Reynolds painted
another portrait of her as Countess of Derby, a whole-length which was
engraved by William Dickinson; this picture has, however, disappeared,
probably destroyed by her husband after his divorce. ¶ Little Miss
Murray of Kirkcudbright in a plain white dress with a black silk scarf
thrown over her head and shoulders and funny blue shoes, stands in a
landscape, her hands loosely crossed in front of her. By her side sits
a curious woolly white dog with black spots on its face, which has no
appearance of life, and shows how inferior in this respect Sir Joshua
was to Gainsborough, who stands with Velasquez among the greatest
dog painters of the world. The landscape in this picture is of quite
unusual excellence, and with the fine breezy sky forms an effective and
pleasing background to the figure of the blue-eyed little Scotch girl.
¶ Who was the sitter for the portrait called The Little Gardener, it
seems at the present time impossible to discover; it shows a pretty
young girl sitting dreamily on a bank at the edge of a wood; she
wears a white dress with a crimson sash, and with her right hand she
loosely holds a straw bonnet decorated with pink ribbons.</p>

<p>There is at Somerley only one male portrait of great importance by Sir Joshua
Reynolds. This represents George, third Duke of Marlborough, and is a
magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
three-quarter length portrait. The duke wears a rich coat of brown
embroidered silk and a mantle of crimson velvet bordered with white
fur thrown over his right shoulder; his left arm rests upon a column,
and the upper portion of the body is outlined against a beautiful
sky background. The pose is evidently inspired by Van Dyck, and the
portrait lacks none of the dignity and elegance of the older master.
An almost exactly similar painting is in the possession of the Earl
of Pembroke, in which however the duke’s dark dress is replaced by
one of white embroidered satin. ¶ Some dozen portraits of the usual
half-length format (about 30 in. by 25 in.) are contained in the
Normanton collection, and not a few of them are of superlative quality.
Among the most pleasing is that of the Misses Horneck, as original as
it is graceful in composition; many failures have resulted from the
attempt thus to group two life-size heads in so small a space, but Sir
Joshua has here admirably succeeded in avoiding stiffness and crowding
while preserving perfect pictorial unity. Painted in a light key about
the year 1775, this picture is in a wonderful state of preservation,
having retained all its freshness of tone and delicacy of modelling. An
unfinished sketch of the same subject, slightly larger in size, belongs
to Sir Henry Bunbury, a descendant of the elder sister’s husband, the
caricaturist, Henry William Bunbury. Mrs. Bunbury (Catharine Horneck),
who is seen on the right of the group, was Goldsmith’s ‘Little Comedy,’
whilst her sister Mary, afterwards Mrs. Gwyn, is celebrated by him as
‘The Jessamy Bride.’ The excellent though slightly faded portrait of
Miss Anne Liddell was bought by the second Lord Normanton at Christie’s
in May, 1867, at the sale of Mr. H. A. J. Munro, of Novar, for 225
guineas. Miss Liddell, who is represented in a black low-cut dress
and black cloak trimmed with white fur, holding some flowers in her
right hand, was a daughter of Lord Ravensworth; she became Duchess
of Grafton, and after divorcing in 1769 married the Earl of Upper
Ossory. The pair of heads of the Earl and Countess of Pembroke, painted
within the last years of the artist’s life, cost Lord Normanton only
30 guineas in 1827. Lord and Lady Pembroke were the parents of Diana,
Lady Normanton, and the countess is the same lady whom Sir Joshua
represented some years previously as Una with the lion; she wears her
peeress’s robes of crimson and ermine over a white low-necked dress,
and the earl is in uniform of red and gold. It is interesting to find
side by side with these examples of the end of the painter’s career the
picture of A Boy Reading, which is inscribed ‘1747, J<sup>a</sup> Reynolds pinxit
Nov.’ and which is one of the earliest known works of the artist, when
he was only twenty-three years of age. It is said to be a portrait of
himself, but this is by no means certain, although the boy’s features
bear a certain resemblance to those of Sir Joshua. With hair falling
over his shoulders, and arms leaning on a table, he reads from a large
book which he holds open with both hands; four more books lie on the
table beside him. It is related that on seeing this picture after
an interval of many years Sir Joshua remarked that he had made but
little progress since he painted it. Although this observation must
not be taken too literally, there is no doubt that even at this early
period he exhibited uncommon mastery of his art. To an early period
also, probably between 1755 and 1760, the portrait of Lady Charlotte
Johnstone, daughter of the first Earl of Halifax, and that of Mrs.
Russell, daughter of Mr. Flountia Vassall, are shown to belong by the
marked attention paid to detail, by a certain tightness of drawing, and
also by the faded flesh-tints due to Reynolds’s excessive use at this
time of brilliant but unstable carmine. Both are painted in profile,
wearing rich dresses of similar pattern, with pearls in their ears
and round their throat. Probably a little later in date is the very
decorative and somewhat French-looking portrait of Miss Meux<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span> (engraved
as Miss Muse); she wears a Louis XV costume, the bodice all tucks and
frills, and a flat gipsy straw hat trimmed with pink ribbons; she has
two rows of pearls round her throat, and the muslin gimp which covers
her breast is spotted with little pink rosettes. This is no doubt the
picture which Lord Normanton bought for 135 gns. at the Novar sale
in 1867, and which was then said to be a portrait of Fanny Reynolds
(Sir Joshua’s sister). Another beautiful half-length picture is that
of the actress Mrs. Quarrington, as St. Agnes, in a brown dress over
which hangs a dark green mantle. She holds a lamb in her arms and a
palm branch in her left hand; the pathetic face, surrounded by her
loose locks of hair, is upturned in an attitude of prayer. Nor must
mention be omitted of a pretty and powerful octagonal study of a
little girl’s head with pearls in her hair, the shoulders covered
with a light white drapery. ¶ The oval portrait of Mrs. Inchbald is
catalogued in more than one volume of recent date as a work by Sir
Joshua; it is, however, hard and unconvincing, and the flesh and
black dress are too weakly painted not to leave a doubt in one’s mind
whether it is not rather the production of one of Reynolds’s pupils,
most probably Northcote. It is difficult also to admit the portrait of
Admiral Barrington to be entirely from the master’s hand; there is a
similar portrait by him in Greenwich Hospital, and it is known that six
replicas were made at the time in Sir Joshua’s studio; this is one of
them, and, although painted under his supervision, it is probable that
his own brush took but little part in the work. Possibly a replica
of the famous picture in the Chamberlayne collection, but also more
probably the work of a contemporary copyist, is the Lady Hamilton as a
Bacchante, a subject rendered familiar by numerous engravings, notably
Bartolozzi’s beautiful colour-print. No doubt whatever is possible in
the case of The Little Archer, the figure of a boy lying full length
in a landscape; here the methods of Sir Joshua are palpably imitated,
but the poor drawing and the ugly obtrusiveness of the boy’s white
stockings preclude any possibility of the master having in any way
contributed to its painting. ¶ A number of acknowledged copies of
pictures by Sir Joshua Reynolds are also to be found at Somerley, and
some are not devoid of merit. Among the best may be mentioned Mrs.
Siddons as the Tragic Muse, painted by the Duchess of Buckingham, from
the original now at Grosvenor House, of which a genuine replica hangs
at Dulwich; also Mrs. Gwyn in Persian costume, a good contemporary
reproduction of the picture which belongs to Mr. W. W. Astor. ¶ It
would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of this group of
pictures by Sir Joshua Reynolds; the genius of the Royal Academy’s
first president is displayed at Somerley in its every phase, and
each period of his career is represented by one or more works of the
highest artistic value; there, he can be studied as it is impossible
to study him elsewhere, at the same time that a comparison can be made
with masterpieces of other great English painters which hang in Lord
Normanton’s magnificent gallery.</p>

would certainly be unfair to consider Louis XIV and espeacially
Colbert, from the point of view of the part played of the royal
manufactory of crown furniture at the Gobelins, as being merely
unconscious instruments. There is no doubt that a formal act of will
on their part entered into this creation. But, once having done this
justice, especially to Colbert, we are bound to remark, if we would
wish to take a sane view of events, that an institution of this kind
was, at the moment when it was established in France, the result of a
series of previous efforts, all turned in the same direction; was the
result also of a general movement of centralization which was to be
one of the sources of weakness, of the system of government adopted in
France. ¶ The founding of the academy of painting and sculpture had
completed the organization of art in the great sense; the founding
of the manufactory of the Gobelins was destined to bring about the
centralization of the minor arts and to strike a blow at the old
edifice of the rules of the corporations. We must make no mistake: from
the artistic point of view, the monarchy largely began the salutary
work of emancipation which the French Revolution was to complete, and
we may well be surprised that right-minded persons should discover a
source of weakness and decadence in the modifications introduced into
the life of the workshops. To be logical we should have to blame
the monarchy itself, which, nearly 150 years before the Revolution,
began, by a devious course it is true, to take away all force from
restrictive laws, from rules and regulations which already seemed out
of date at the end of the middle ages. It will be seen that, though the
complete abolition of the rules of the corporations did, in certain
cases, become a cause of confusion, we should do wrong to look upon it
as the sole cause of the degeneration in artistic feeling in the minor
arts at the commencement of the nineteenth century. The suppression of
the corporations under the Revolution was as inevitable an event as
was under Louis XIV the establishment of official artistic workshops.
The whole lay in the manner of setting to work to decree those two
measures. ¶ To second his views, Colbert was fortunate enough to have
at hand an exceptional man, one who was at the same time an organizer
and an artist, two qualities rarely united in one and the same brain;
and he also had the good sense to select him in spite of appearances.
He did more, for after selecting him he left him the most complete
liberty. And yet Charles Le Brun might have passed as suspect in the
minds of both the king and Colbert. ¶ Born in Paris on February 24,
1619, Charles Le Brun was the son of Nicholas Le Brun, a sculptor. His
first masters were Perrier, a Burgundian painter, and Simon Vouet; and
it was doubtless through Vouet’s intermediary that he became acquainted
with the Chancellor Séguier, in whom he was later to find a firm friend
and a constant protector. Some works executed for the Cardinal de
Richelieu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span> earned for him the title of painter to the king in 1638.
In 1642, he accompanied Nicolas Poussin to Rome and was admitted as
a master-painter into the corporation. He returned to Paris in 1646,
received the title of <i>valet de chambre</i> to the king, and married
Suzanne Butay, a painter’s daughter. ¶ A law-suit between the wardens
of the Gild of Painters and the king’s painters, the so-called ‘patent
painters,’ suddenly made Le Brun conspicuous, and, after the favourable
decision pronounced by the parliament, with the support of Séguier he
contributed not a little towards the definite foundation of the academy
of painting (1648). But, while fighting strenuously for the principles
of his art, Le Brun neglected no opportunity of practising it, and
executed for a number of Paris mansions a series of large decorative
compositions, for which he had acquired the taste in Italy. The houses
of Bertrand de la Bazinière, treasurer of the <i>Épargne</i>; of
Marshal d’Aumont; of the Chevalier de Jars; of Inselin, treasurer of
the <i>Chambre aux Deniers</i>; of Lambert de Thorigny, president of
the <i>Chambre des Comptes</i>, were decorated by him in turns. In the
last of these mansions he painted the Galerie d’Hercule, which still
exists, and the sight of which eventually determined the Superintendent
Fouquet to send for Le Brun to Vaux (1657). Here, in the sumptuous
residence of Vaux, of which Fouquet was to have the enjoyment for so
short a while, Le Brun displayed his full powers. He not only painted
or designed such compositions as the Apothéose d’Hercule, the Triomphe
de la Fidélité, L’Aurore, Le Sommeil, the Palais du Soleil, but he
also directed the sculptors, ornament workers and silversmiths, the
tapestry workers and embroiderers, and managed the manufactory of
high-warp tapestry established by Fouquet at Maincy. He supplied so
large a number of models and cartoons for tapestry, that many of his
compositions could be executed only much later at the manufactory
of the Gobelins; the Chasses de Méléagre, Mars et Venus, Jupiter
allaité par la chèvre Amalthée, five pieces representing the history of
Constantine, the Muses, all bear witness to the prodigious fertility of
an artist who, like the great Italians of the Renaissance, was lavish
in production while developing his admirable administrative qualities.
¶ If these gigantic works at the Château de Vaux had not succeeded in
earning for him the esteem of Mazarin and of the queen-mother, Anne of
Austria, and also in drawing the attention of the king (for Le Brun
was the organizer of the great <i>fêtes</i> given by the Superintendent
in 1659), it might have happened that our artist would have incurred
the same disgrace as his patron. Very fortunately this was not so;
for once talent was able to silence envy, and Le Brun was admirably
served by circumstances. In 1660, the king ordered a large picture
of him, Alexandre pénétrant dans la tente de Darius, and the city of
Paris instructed him to erect a triumphal arch on the Place Dauphine
for the entry into Paris of Louis XIV and his queen, Maria Theresa. In
1661 he entered into relations with Colbert; in 1662 he received the
much-coveted title of ‘first painter to the king.’ We see, therefore,
that his connexion with Fouquet—and it does not seem that Le Brun was
ever placed in the painful situation of having to deny the man who had
enabled him to make his mark—so far from harming him, had, on the
contrary, done him good service. Perhaps the king, at the same time
that Colbert began to suspect his exceptional powers as an organizer
and administrator, recognized in Le Brun one of those men who were to
be so useful to his thirst for stately glory and royal pomp.</p>

<p>One last circumstance enabled Le Brun to make himself absolutely indispensable
to the king’s glory. On February 6, 1661, the first floor of the small
gallery of the Louvre was almost totally destroyed by fire. Our artist
was commissioned to renew its decoration; he made of this a monument to
the glory of Apollo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
the god of the sun, a delicate attention which enabled him to indulge
in more or less delicate allusions with his brush to the king himself.
All the works—which, for that matter, were never finished under Louis
XIV: the works at the other royal residences, and particularly at
Versailles, thrust the Galerie d’Apollon into the background—were
directed solely by Le Brun: he got together a little army of sculptors
and decorators, among whom we recall the names of Gaspard and Balthazar
de Marsy, François Girardon, Thomas Regnauldin, Monnoyer, the brothers
Lemoyne and Ballin, whose fortunes were thenceforth closely linked
with those of the first painter to the king. ¶ The letters patent
of Louis XIV instituting the ‘royal manufactory of crown furniture’
are dated November 1667, but they sanction a state of things that
existed as far back as 1663. I shall analyse briefly this deed of
foundation, most of whose dispositions it is very important for us
to know, showing as they do how the machinery of administration was
capable of being simplified in the seventeenth century. Let me here
remind my readers that the name of ‘Gobelins,’ which to-day serves to
designate the tapestries issuing from the famous manufactory, dates
back to the fifteenth century. At that time a dyer called Jean Gobelin,
a native of Rheims, settled on the banks of the little river Bièvre.
His trade prospered so well that his name was given to his house and
workshop, near to which came to live Marc de Comano and François de la
Planche, the Flemish upholsterers installed in Paris by Henry IV. In
1662 Colbert joined the old house of the Gobelins to the workshops of
the descendants of Comano and La Planche; and on these premises was
installed the new manufactory which was destined to perpetuate the
memory of the name of the humble dyer of the fifteenth century.</p>

man of taste will congratulate himself that England is the
seat and the refuge of the arts; and that so many genuine remains
of ancient sculpture are present in our cabinets.’ So wrote James
Dallaway at the beginning of last century, and, although some may
think that the arts have now somewhat altered their habits, there is
no doubt that this country still remains pre-eminent in the wealth of
its private collections of Greek antiquities. If proof were needed,
this admirable little collection would afford it. When the scheme was
first mooted of a Greek exhibition at the Burlington Club, a moderate
scepticism was not altogether unnatural. The former attempt in 1888
had not been exactly an enthusiastic success, and somehow the club
itself appeared to be a somewhat stern soil for so tender a plant. A
society of dilettanti, with grave and reverend opinions upon every
conceivable form of bigotry and virtue, might be expected either to
adopt an attitude of cold aloofness or to overlay its offspring with
excessive and even (may one whisper it?) injudicious appreciation. But
we never know where a blessing may light, and, if one may judge from
the assiduous attention the exhibition has received, not only from the
sternest critics of the club, but from the smart ladies of at least
two capitals, a new era has dawned for Greek art; if it only lasts
long enough, intrepid explorers will be found invading Bloomsbury, and
the British Museum will cease to offer cool solitudes for the peaceful
reflection of the philosopher and student. ¶ For the general public who
have little time or inclination for long museum galleries, this sort
of exhibition has much to recommend it; the intelligent public likes
to have its culture prescribed for it in tabloid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span> form—a small dose,
unmistakably potent, which can be easily digested between meals. To
this form of requirement the Burlington Club is admirably adapted: a
single room, with just enough space for arranging a few good things.
Mrs. Strong and her committee are so much to be congratulated that it
seems ungracious to grumble; but personally I should have preferred
to turn out about half of the less fine objects. It was difficult, no
doubt; the susceptibilities of lenders are not lightly to be trifled
with; but Greek art, more than most things, needs plenty of breathing
space, and the exhibition would have gained by a judicious depletion.
¶ I think it was M. Piot who used to carry always in his waistcoat
pocket a few of the choicest Greek coins (those being the most portable
forms of the best art), as he said, ‘to correct his eye’; that was
undoubtedly a true instinct. When all is said and done, Greek art will
always serve as an admirable corrective—within its limits of course,
for painting is obviously excluded—and that is at least some comfort
in these impressionist days, when new creeds lie about like leaves in
Vallombrosa. ¶ I overheard one day a visitor to this exhibition angrily
resenting the suggestion that Greek art at its best could be compared
for a moment with the master works of the middle ages. It is a large
question, which there is no space here to argue, only I do not think it
is so easily dismissed as the hasty critic supposed. I should even be
prepared to stand by some of the objects here exhibited. After all, it
is in many cases the same plant growing up under differing conditions
of time and circumstance. Some day perhaps the club may be persuaded to
try the experiment of showing side by side some of the finest parallel
achievements of antiquity and the three centuries of mediaeval Europe.</p>

<p>And I am not sure that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
the plan might not be adopted with advantage in museums, of having
a small room, like the <i>tribuna</i> at Florence for instance,
with a florilegium of the best things of all dates; it would be
both physically and mentally a boon to many a weary wayfarer. ¶ The
most obvious point of comparison with the classical is the work of
the classicists of north-east Italy, who, already at the end of the
trecento, were beginning a formal but intelligent study of the antique.
It would be instructive to see works of Donatello and John of Bologna
side by side with their Greek counterparts; a Syracusan decadrachm
of Kimon or Euainetos beside a medal of Pisanello or Sperandio. ¶
One bronze in the Burlington Club especially seems to challenge this
comparison—the big mounted warrior (No. 53), which at first sight
suggests a kind of glorified gothic aquamanile. A reviewer in the
<i>Athenaeum</i> points out the ‘research for elegance which already
characterizes this figure,’ and which he considers to mark the
essential difference between the Greeks and their successors. ‘Whereas
the Greek,’ he says, ‘feels most keenly the planes, to the northern
and Italian artists it is the ridges that count.’ This seems to me to
be a plausible generalization from imperfectly perceived facts. The
world-old contrast of the ideal and the real naturally went on in Greek
art as it has gone on in every other art; but less among the Greeks,
because for most of their history they steadily withstood realism;
they believed and acted upon Shakespeare’s ‘Nature is made better by
no mean, but nature makes that mean.’ At a late period realism became
too strong for them, and the Pergamene school was the beginning of the
end. Surely the broad contrasting of planes is not the characteristic
of a race, but of a stage of development. Obviously the sculptor in
marble or wood is bound to set out by blocking out his figure in broad
planes: relative development shows itself in the amount of skill which
the artist exhibits in graduating and refining these planes into each
other. Early Greek art shows this particularly, because it derived
largely from Egyptian traditions, and was long in breaking loose from
set canons. But it is none the less true of all sculpture in which an
historical development can be traced. The history of Italian sculpture
down to Michael Angelo is so much under classical influence that
its evolution may almost be said to be an index of its information
regarding Greek art. Michael Angelo unfortunately corresponds to
the Pergamene stage. Already, before his day, the great Italian
medallists had shown in their medal work what is probably, outside of
classical times, the nearest approach to the best Greek relief, and
they worked largely on Greek lines. It is not by coincidence alone
that the helmeted knight on the well-known medal of Ludovico Gonzaga
naturally suggests an analogy to the bronze now exhibited. In both
cases the simple effect is attained by a judicious elimination, by
contrasted planes, and by a skilful co-ordination into an harmonious
whole. ¶ This bronze is said to have been found at Grumentum, in
Lucania, a city which, as its name and its geographical position show,
was never a Greek colony, though latterly a town of some importance.
Probably it found its way there in the course of Corinthian traffic:
the long-bodied horse, the unusual subject of a helmeted horseman,
the treatment of mane and tail, are all characteristic rather of the
Corinthian art of the sixth century <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>; and we know how
active the Corinthian colonists were at that period in south Italy.
¶ The same characteristic treatment is seen in the splendid bronze
head from Chatsworth (No. 8). It is an Apollo rather over life size,
belonging to that interesting transitional stage which immediately
precedes the Parthenon. In this case, however, the archaism is partly
conscious; the artist realizes the maxim <i>peu de moyens, beaucoup
d’effet</i>, and uses it to advantage. The type chosen is that of a
strong virile athlete, with hair still long, but just budding into
manhood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span> the Βούπαις (‘bully boy’), as Furtwängler points out, of
an epigram on a contemporary statue of him by Onatas. What a contrast
this to the soft and dreamy Sauroktonos of the succeeding century: with
its almost architectural symmetry, its vigorous subordination of all
search for detail to general effect, and its mathematical balance of
large lines and large planes, it seems to stand as a visible protest
against weakness and effeminacy. As Emerson puts it, this one head
might be the indemnification for populations of pygmies or weaklings.
The step from this to the Parthenon is short in point of years, but
is artistically an interval which is strongly defined, for within its
limit Greek sculpture has entered into its birthright. This stage is
nobly represented in the exhibition by the fragment from a slab of
the north frieze of the Parthenon, reproduced in Plate I. Broken away
probably at the time of the Venetian bombardment, it seems to have been
acquired in Athens by Stuart, who sent it to Smyrna; a few years ago it
was dug up beside a rockery in a garden in Essex; what its movements
were between Smyrna and Essex is matter for conjecture. A former owner
of the Essex property was a Mr. Astle, who was a trustee of the British
Museum, and may be supposed to have had an interest in antiquities:
<i>habent sua fata</i>, these flotsam relics of antiquity: this is
not the only marble in the exhibition which has been excavated on
English soil. The head (No. 24), which early in the seventeenth century
belonged to the famous Arundel collection, was recently dug up by a
navvy in London close to the Temple, on the site that was once part of
the Arundel house garden. ¶ The surface of the Parthenon fragment has
suffered, of course, but not so grievously as might be expected. It
gives the head of one of the mounted knights of the north frieze, and
the horse’s head of the figure immediately following him. The youth
is from northern Greece, probably from one of the Thracian colonies
of Athens, as his Thracian headdress of foxskin (the <i>alopeke</i>)
shows. That his horse is in movement even the fragment makes clear by
the light tresses of hair blown backward beneath his cap, of which the
heavy tail is itself curved outward by the motion; but his eyes are
intently set on his forward path, and the firm and straight yet supple
poise of neck and torso bespeak his ‘magic horsemanship.’ The figure
behind him (preserved in the British Museum), a squadron commander or
marshal, turns partly round in his seat, checking his horse, apparently
to give an order to his section; with the suddenness of the action the
horse’s mouth is wrenched open and his head thrown back, the plaited
forelock swings upward, and every muscle is tense; the motive is a
subtle variation on the theme represented by the splendid horse’s head
of Selene or Night in the eastern pediment, but with this principal
difference, that while this horse is answering to its rider’s curb, the
Selene horse is probably starting back of its own accord, in alarm at
taking the downward plunge. Now that this beautiful fragment has found
its way to London, is it too much to hope that it may make one more
journey—and that its last—to Bloomsbury, and rejoin the slab to which
it fits?</p>

<p>From Pheidias it is natural to turn to that other sculptor
who shared with him the glory of the latter part of the fifth century.
Polykleitos, the leader of the Argive school, did for the physical
ideal what Pheidias had done for the religious. His earliest recorded
work, the statue of a boy-boxer crowning himself with a wreath, set
up at Olympia about 440 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, has been identified in four
different replicas, of which one is the head belonging to Sir Edgar
Vincent (No. 45), shown on Plate III. The statue-base itself was found
at Olympia in 1877, still bearing its dedicatory inscription, and with
marks showing that the figure was of bronze. From a marble copy to a
bronze original, and that of an artist whose bronze technique
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
was by many considered pre-eminent in antiquity, is a far cry, but
even in this head we may see some faint reflection of the genius of
Polykleitos. The curved surfaces definitely meet and intersect instead
of merging almost insensibly into one another, as happens in marble
work. In this respect an admirable contrast is offered by the famous
head of Aphrodite, belonging to Lord Leconfield, on Plate II. This
head, which is in the catalogue (No. 22) boldly described as ‘an
original by Praxiteles,’ in acceptation of a suggestion originally due
to Payne Knight, and later adopted by Furtwängler, is undoubtedly the
most beautiful Aphrodite head in this artist’s style which has come
down to us. A comparison of it with that of the Olympian Hermes and
with the copies of the Knidian Aphrodite makes this identification at
least highly probable. The hair is apparently roughly finished and
almost sketchy, but offers an admirable contrast to the highly polished
surface of the flesh, and even without the colour which certainly
once covered it is magically successful in its rendering of texture.
The high triangular forehead-space, which gives distinction to the
type and value to the setting of the eyes, is almost identical with
the forehead of the Knidian Aphrodite, and also that of the Knidian
Demeter, a statue certainly under strong Praxitelean influence: the
slight projection over the brows, the so-called ‘bar of Michael
Angelo,’ which is so marked a feature in the Hermes, is introduced here
with extraordinary delicacy of effect. It is no wonder that Lucian
singled out for praise in the Aphrodite of Praxiteles ‘the beautiful
line of her forehead and brow, and her melting eye, full of joy and
of pleasure.’ The eyes indeed are especially characteristic; their
narrow opening in proportion to the length (<i>yeux bridés</i>), the
slight projection of the lower lid, which gives an indescribable
softness to the shadow beneath it, the almost imperceptible transition
at the outer corner both of eye and mouth, are all traits which
belong to Praxiteles alone. The oval contour is skilfully redeemed
from formality by the dimple in the chin, just as the columnar neck
is softened by the soft fold midway. For beneath all the refinement,
which might easily become voluptuous, there is withal a physical
dignity of form which bespeaks the goddess, ‘che muove il sole e l’
altre stelle.’ The artist ‘keeps the two vases, one of aether and one
of pigment, at his side, and invariably uses both.’ ¶ In the presence
of this masterpiece it is difficult to share the admiration which
the catalogue bestows on the Head of a Girl from Chios (No. 44). The
intention of the sculptor was obviously to reproduce a Praxitelean
type; but whatever this head may once have been, the entire surface has
been so rubbed down that it now looks like a model in partly melted
loaf sugar. Under these circumstances any close study of the details
is fruitless, but the characteristic features, especially the mouth,
are so weakly conceived that it probably looks as pretty now, half
hidden under a ‘baldacchino,’ as ever it did; its prettiness indeed
seems to be its highest claim to notice.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> ¶ The head belonging to
Mr. Claude Ponsonby on Plate III has lately been claimed as Lysippean
by M. Salomon Reinach. Unfortunately we know very little of the
characteristic treatment of the features by Lysippos; we know that
he was essentially a worker in bronze, that he introduced a more
natural treatment of the hair and an animation of facial expression,
and that this last qualification naturally led him into portraiture.
The general outline of the eye cavities, and the form and modelling
of the forehead, closely resemble those of the Alexander portrait
in the British Museum; and the rendering of the hair has a certain
naturalism which is also found in the Alexander: moreover there is a
tragic intensity in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span> the almost haggard eyes and parted lips which,
together with the loosened tresses and the drapery covering the back
of the head, certainly mark the head as the portrait of a mourning
woman. Further than this perhaps we cannot go; but it is worth noting
that Tatian mentions the portrait of a woman (the Praxilla) by Lysippos,
which we may presume to have been something like this. Michaelis
suggests that it may have belonged to ‘the statue of a mourning woman
which may have served as the decoration of some sepulchral monument.’
This is probably not far from the truth; at any rate the head seems to
stand midway between the conventionalized portraits of the Athenian
stelae and the more realistic portraiture of the Hellenistic age, well
represented in the exhibition by the busts of Menander (No. 26) and the
presumed Hipponax (No. 27). ¶ The <i>genre</i> side of Hellenistic art
is well represented in the exhibition by the large bronze statuette
of Eros, a dexterous figure of a winged laughing boy rushing forward
through space with outspread wings and right foot just touching
the ground; Mrs. Strong justly points to the motive as an ultimate
evolution from that of the Nike of Samothrace, wherein the weight of
the body seems partly supported by the foot and partly by the spread
wings, which serve as a counterpoise to the structure. It is quite
in consonance with Hellenistic sentiment that the love-god should be
shown as the victor in the sacred torch race, the Lampadephoria —Eros
the unconquerable, the ἀνίκατος μάχαν, invades the palaestra and beats
the athlete at his own game. ¶ When I first saw this charming figure
(it was in a room at the Charing Cross Hotel, on his first arrival
here) the then owner told me the circumstances of his discovery. Not
far south of Vesuvius the river Sirmio finds its way to the sea; at a
spot on the Pompeii side which probably in antiquity marked a ferry or
ford, this statuette with other things was excavated. The presumption
is that the hapless owner, fleeing from the eruption with his treasure
under his arm, was overtaken here, possibly while waiting for the
ferry-boat. It is a tragic little history, all the more touching
somehow on account of the subject which the figure represents. ¶ In
its collection of smaller bronzes the exhibition is particularly rich.
A small selection is here given in Plate IV. The archaic period is
represented by the little crouching or, more probably, dancing Seilenos
(No. 34), the wild animalistic sprite of the woods, half bearded man
and half horse, as Ionic art depicted him; by the amphora handle (No.
92) in the form of a youth bent backwards below two panthers which
rested on the lip of the vase; and by the charming little Aphrodite
(No. 20) whose formal drapery and pose, combined with a refinement of
delicate modelling, are together characteristic of the springtime of
Greek art. With her may be contrasted the tiny nude Aphrodite (No.
11) to which an ancient admirer has presented a necklace, bracelet,
and anklet in gold, probably, as Mrs. Strong suggest, an adaptation
of a famous statue by Praxiteles. ¶ On Plate V is a fine example of
the repoussé mirror-covers which seem to have belonged exclusively to
the fourth and third centuries <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> The nearly full-grown
Eros with long wings is characteristic rather of the earlier stage;
otherwise the subject, in which he assists a lady or his mother at her
toilet, is a favourite one for this class of representation. An unusual
form of mirror support is Mr. Wallis’s plaque (No. 62), which has the
design cut out <i>à jour</i>, as beautiful in its pale blue patina
as it is in the dexterous adaptation of the composition to the space
which it has to fill. The owner suggests that the reclining winged boy
is Hypnos rather than Eros; if so, it is an unusual rendering of the
god of sleep.</p>

<p>The Alexandrine period is represented on Plate IV by
Mr. Salting’s fine mask of a sea deity (No. 113) with inlaid eyes and
marine emblems skilfully worked in, suggestive of the grotesque masks
of Pompeian and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
cinquecento Italian art; and by Mr. Wyndham Cook’s puzzling seated
statuette of an emaciated man (No. 50). This figure has usually been
described as a pathological study, a votive offering to Asklepios
from a sick person. The careful workmanship, however, and the fact
that it is inscribed with the name of the personage represented seem
to militate against this view; moreover the figure does not seem
to represent actual suffering so much as austerity. The excessive
emaciation, the pose, and the fixed abstracted expression appear to me
to indicate rather ecstasy, the ἔκστασις of the mystic, the Pythagorean
anchorite who, like the Brahmin, has learnt by mortification of the
flesh to project his soul into the unseen. We know the interest that
Alexander took in the Indian <i>yogins</i>, and that he had intended
to bring one of them, Kalanos, back with him to Greece. It is not
improbable that other Greeks may have taken up the idea: and it is
significant that this bronze was found at Alexander’s own city of Pella
and bears a Macedonian name. If this be so, it adds an extraordinary
and unique interest to the little bronze. ¶ The group of terracotta
statuettes on Plate VI are chosen as characteristic types of different
forms of this charming art. The little doll (No. 24) made, perhaps,
in imitation of a Persephone figure, but intended to have movable
limbs, and the Caryatid figure (No. 26) belong to the fifth century;
the latter is remarkable for its strongly Pheidian character of type
and drapery, and is certainly of Attic work nearly contemporary with
the Parthenon. The young Dionysos (No. 7) and the two girls (Nos. 3
and 10) are good instances of the peculiarly modern sentiment which
pervaded the art as well as the literature of the Hellenistic age.
These figures are the bric-à-brac of antiquity; the far-away ancestors
of Dresden, and Saxe, and Watteau, with some of their coquetry and
none of their artificiality. ¶ Before leaving the terracottas it is
necessary to mention the large head of Zeus (No. 46) which has been
added since the exhibition opened; Professor Furtwängler and Mrs.
Strong consider this head to be ‘a Greek work of the great period of
Pheidias.’ It is particularly unpleasant to me to find myself differing
entirely from their view; after close and repeated examination I am
bound to say that it seems to me to belong to a well-known class of
terracottas which are now generally agreed to be of modern origin. ¶
Of the collection of vases there is only space here to include three
typical specimens (Plate VII); these are the kylix signed by the artist
Tleson (No. 16), with a charming drawing of two goats rearing up and
butting one another above a floral ornament; a good example of the
skill with which the Greek artist pressed into his service as pure
decoration a common scene of daily life; the plate (No. 79), signed by
Epiktetos, with its humorous ride-a-cock-horse subject, the precursor
of the Parthenon horseman riding on his own fighting-cock; and the
krater from Harrow School (No. 44), with its masterly composition
of the hero Kaineus overwhelmed by the Centaurs. In its strong firm
line, and spirited composition, which is yet kept in subordination to
the decorative effect of the vase as a whole, this work stands out
instinct with the combination of strength and self-control which are
the leading characteristics of the best works of Hellenic art. ¶ I
have already occupied so much space that the very important series of
engraved gems and coins must remain almost unnoticed, and this is a
pity because outside the great museums we are not likely ever to see
such a series again assembled. The beautiful drawings of Greece by
Cockerell, the wandering artist-scholar, one of the great builders of
English artistic repute in the Levant, these too must be left with a
bare mention. But this fact in itself speaks for the high standard
attained by the exhibition, on which Mrs. Strong and the club are much
to be congratulated.</p>

<span class="smaller">AND</span> T<span class="smaller">IME</span>. By
Corrado Ricci. Translated by Florence Simmons. William Heinemann, 1902.</h3>

<p class="p0">The publication by Mr. Heinemann of a large, costly, and elaborately
illustrated book upon Pintoricchio is evidence that this long-neglected
Umbrian painter is growing in popularity. Effaced for more than two and
a half centuries by the dazzling radiance of his younger contemporary’s
fame, Pintoricchio’s individuality, first appreciated by Rumohr, began
clearly to stand out again only when Morelli demonstrated that he was
the author of two frescoes in the Sixtine chapel. Even then he borrowed
his lustre from working where Michelangelo left his masterpieces,
and from having, as Morelli pointed out, influenced Raphael. It
remained for the anarchical taste of recent years to exalt him into an
important ‘Master’ on his own account. ¶ The occasion was offered by
the reopening in 1897 of the Borgia apartments, which he decorated;
for although the popes may have lost their power to immortalize
themselves by feats of statesmanship, the ambition to signalize their
pontificates by the patronage of art appears not wholly to have died
out. Leo XIII in restoring and opening to the public the magnificent
suite of rooms where, in the service of Alexander VI, Pintoricchio
toiled to make a monument to his patron, was no less the maker of
an artistic reputation than his Renaissance predecessors—with the
significant difference, however, that he conferred a posthumous fame,
a <i>succès d’archéologie</i>, instead of the renown that came from
the commission to rebuild and decorate that city of cities which has
now passed from under the papal sway. ¶ But, unless the lay world had
been independently attuned to Pintoricchio’s art, papal patronage
would not have carried his renown far. But modern art is just at a
point where Pintoricchio is really more sympathetic than the masters
of the great style, for in the break-up of artistic tradition and the
decline of classical taste the decorator of to-day is thrown back upon
parading the mere materials of his art, upon bright colour and relief,
upon sumptuousness, and the startling and attractive. He has, in fact,
dedicated himself to ornamentation—for we must not debase the word
decoration! And of ornamentation, of the sumptuous, the attractive,
the gay and the ingenious, Pintoricchio was a master. The gorgeousness
of the Borgia apartments delude even critics who ought to distinguish
more subtly, into praising them as art. It is so difficult to be stern
with the attractive! ¶ And so Pintoricchio, becoming popular, needed a
handsome book to reveal him further to his English admirers; and for
them, being English, a volume of mere illustrations, like the French
tome of M. Boyer d’Agen, did not suffice. There must be the flavour of
pedantry, of Morellianism, of research into origins, without omitting
the necessary historical setting. And so the publisher commissioned
the valiant Dr. Ricci, head of the great gallery of the Brera, to
prepare such a work, knowing well that he could not entrust it to
more skilful and conscientious hands. But, contrary to the Biblical
story, instead of blessing Israel the emissary of Balak was unable to
keep his tongue from curses! Dr. Ricci’s taste was too cultivated,
his experience of great art too profound, to permit him to raise the
chosen painter to the altar prepared for him, and the publisher was
thus constrained to write a short ‘Note’ explaining that, in spite of
what the author says, Pintoricchio really <i>is</i> a great artist,
standing only just below ‘the three or four supreme masters’—close,
that is to say, to Raphael, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Giorgione!
Turning, however, to Dr. Ricci’s estimate, we find it absolutely
sane and just:—‘Pintoricchio ... was more attracted by the external
splendours of art than by its sentiment ... is wholly destitute of
passion ... and shows but little research in the matter of expression.’
And instead of joining in the unreserved praise accorded to him in the
publisher’s ‘Note’ as a ‘master of decoration,’ he, on the contrary,
criticizes his artist’s gaudiness and his lack of composition, and
utters a protest, particularly welcome at the present moment, against
the use of raised ornament in decorative painting. Indeed, while
Morelli’s account of Pintoricchio leaves the reader with a general
sense that he was to be preferred to his master Perugino, Dr. Ricci
nowhere loses his sense of proportion, nowhere unduly exalts the
subject of his work, and the resulting impression of his long book is
to place Pintoricchio in a just relation to the artists of his time:
attractive, sweet, agreeable, ‘exuberant and instinctively elegant,’
but almost never entering into rivalry with any master who possessed,
in however small a degree, any of the specifically artistic qualities.
His treatment, indeed, of Pintoricchio’s greatest work, the frescoes
of the cathedral library of Siena, scarcely does justice to the real
artistic merits of the decorative scheme. As these works so far surpass
the frescoes of the Borgia apartments, the impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span> they give of
‘gaiety and well-being,’ which Dr. Ricci barely touches on, might
well have been amplified. But one is grateful to him for pronouncing
himself so clearly against the current notion that the young Raphael
assisted Pintoricchio in these frescoes, instead of mystifying us
with the usual non-committal generalities on this subject; and also
for ranging himself so openly with Morelli and against Signor Venturi
in refusing the absurd ascription of Gentile Bellini’s drawings
to Pintoricchio. He calls attention to a phrase in Gentile’s will
which speaks of drawings of his in Rome, thus amply accounting for
the introduction of figures similar to those in Gentile’s sketches
into the Roman frescoes of the Umbrian painter so notoriously given
to pilfering. ¶ Singularly full and complete is Dr. Ricci’s list of
Pintoricchio’s works; indeed, the fault lies just in this! While we
thank him for sparing no pains to look up every possible work of his
painter, we must reproach him with being too liberal in questions of
authenticity. It is particularly among what Dr. Ricci considers the
early works that we find him too generous. It is in my opinion quite
impossible that Pintoricchio should have executed the Presentation at
Torre d’&#160;Andrea, which shows so many of the characteristics of that
(deservedly) little known painter, Antonio da Viterbo<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, while the
copy at Siena of the central figures in the great ancona of 1498 at
Perugia cannot of course be, as he supposes, an <i>early</i> work,
and seems to me too crude and flaccid to be by him at any period of
his career. The early Madonna in the Bufalini collection at Città di
Castello I cannot clearly remember, but the ruined Madonna with the
infant John in the <i>duomo</i> of that town could certainly never
have been touched by Pintoricchio’s own hand, and Lord Crawford’s
Madonna and Angels at Wigan is too cold and hard for him, and indeed
seems to be the work of some Romagnol imitator of Pintoricchio, whose
youthful hand was trained under the benumbing influence of Palmezzano.
¶ I regret that I cannot quite follow our author in his chronology of
Pintoricchio’s works, for the clear arrangement of which at the end
of his book he nevertheless earns our gratitude. The assumption that
the Ara Coeli frescoes were painted after those in the Sixtine chapel
seems to me to confuse Dr. Ricci’s view of the chronology from the
start. To my eyes they are clearly earlier works, although I know that
Morelli here for once agreed with Crowe and Cavalcaselle, and dated
them as late as 1496. But the whole question is by no means clear,
and I confess to being unable to discover in Dr. Ricci’s book the
exact criteria he uses to determine the date of a particular work.
The Sienese <i>tondo</i> which he calls early seems to me definitely
to belong to the period after 1500, and the two Madonnas at Spello do
not convince me that they are early, or even that they are of the same
date. Dr. Ricci professes himself not quite convinced of the adequacy
of internal evidence; nevertheless, like all unbelievers, he constantly
takes refuge in it, but not consistently, and it is this uncertainty of
method which, perhaps more than anything else, prevents our following
his conclusions with intelligent sympathy. And this one regrets the
more, because with the broad lines of his book, and, above all, with
his estimate of Pintoricchio, one has such hearty sympathy. ¶ A word of
protest must be added about the strange translation and about certain
carelessness apparent in the book-making. ‘Coetanean’ is an odd word to
meet on the first page, and surely Dr. Ricci never spoke of the ‘coast
of Subasio’! ‘S. Bernardine,’ or, worse still, ‘San Bernardine,’ is not
a happy way of anglicizing the name of the Sienese saint, nor is ‘Cybo’
an improvement upon the usual form. ‘Enea’ recurs in an irritating
manner, where every cultivated English person expects Aeneas; for,
since Bishop Creighton’s sympathetic account, ‘Aeneas Silvius,’ whether
as humanist or pope, has become a familiar name. Just here, by the way,
I may express my surprise that among Dr. Ricci’s historical references
for Pope Alexander VI (p. 87) he did not place Creighton’s account,
the best in English, or perhaps in any language. ¶ The subject of the
first coloured plate is misnamed ‘S. Bernardino,’ although in the text
correctly described as St. Louis of Toulouse. And this leads me to
protest against cheap colour reproductions of this kind. The feeblest,
young-lady water-colour sketch after Pintoricchio could not resemble
him less than these coarse, smeared, falsely-tinted reproductions.
They are worse than useless; they are hideously misleading. The other
illustrations of the book, however, are copious and accurate, and we
cannot be too grateful for the reproduction of so many of the pictures
in private collections, photographs of which it is often almost
impossible for the student to procure. M. L.</p>

<h3>A<span class="smaller">NCIENT</span> C<span class="smaller">OFFERS AND</span>
C<span class="smaller">UPBOARDS</span>. By Fred Roe. Methuen &amp; Co.</h3>

<p class="p0">Mr. Fred Roe’s book of ancient coffers and cupboards must surely be
the first of many such monographs. To-day the process block has made
it possible to illustrate with ease the most elaborate details of the
work of the ancient craftsmen, and within the covers of a book we may
bear home our museum to be pored over at leisure. And here we have the
chosen pieces of many museums, many churches, and many collectors’
hoards, in a form which makes them as useful to the new craftsmen as
to the antiquary. It is true that Mr. Roe has not given us process
work alone. Although such illustrations as those of the famous chest
of the twelve knights at the Cluny and the St. George chest at South
Kensington leave nothing to be desired, Mr. Roe does not allow it to be
forgotten that he can use a pencil with effect. His drawings, although
they have nothing of the tight and <span class="antiqua">T</span>-squared manner familiar in
architects’ drawings of old pieces, yet give a pleasant impression of
truth and trustworthiness, and err not on the side of that dangerous
cleverness which so often persuaded that great man M. Viollet le Duc
to translate ornament and detail from every scratch and stain of his
model. With a volume of the <i>Mobilier Français</i> at hand Mr. Roe
may be at issue with the Frenchman on a definite point. Here we have
the great <i>armoire</i> of Noyon as presented spick and span in the
coloured drawing of M. Viollet le Duc, and here we have it also from
the pencil of Mr. Roe. To our mind Mr. Roe seems the more trustworthy
interpreter, but one or other is at fault. On the first of the eight
doors of the <i>armoire</i> Mr. Roe gives us a figure of the Virgin in
a sweeping robe, holding the Child in her arms. M. Viollet le Duc, with
abundant detail, gives us the same door with a bare-legged St. John
Baptist in his camel’s hair, supporting in his arms a lamb. ¶ It is no
disparagement to Mr. Roe’s written commentary to say that the early
history of the chest is told clearly enough by his well-arranged series
of drawings and photographs. We owe him thanks that he has avoided the
temptation which would persuade the writer upon any side of English
archaeology to gallop through his subject from Stonehenge to the great
exhibition within the covers of a single book. Here we have the history
of the mediaeval chest, from the thirteenth-century examples with which
we must perforce begin, to the end of the Gothic work in the fifteen
hundreds. There Mr. Roe stays, and for the story of the Elizabeth and
seventeenth-century chests, which are still in such plenty amongst us,
we may wait in good content for Mr. Roe’s future work. ¶ To those who
are familiar with inventories, and wills, and such-like documents of
the intimate life of our ancestors, the picture of the ancient English
home rises up furnished with a bed, a brass pot, and a chest; for
these good things came ever foremost amongst the few household goods
of folk of the middling sort. It would be difficult to say where the
collector might lay his hand nowadays upon the woodwork of a mediaeval
bed; the brass pots have for the most part served their day and gone
back to the foundry furnace; but the oaken chest remains here and there
in the countryside for a most curious and venerable relic. ¶ We can
hardly doubt that the familiar chest was from the beginning cunningly
decorated; but accurate knowledge begins with the thirteenth century,
with vast fronts of one or more broad beams set longways between two
broad uprights. For ornament we have suggestions of arch-work simply
indicated with chiselled lines and roundels of tracery. The ends are
solidly framed with massive timbers. Of painted chests a notable
example remains at Newport in Essex, and this Mr. Roe shows us in its
colours. The inside of the lid when upreared shows like a painted
reredos with a rood, the Virgin and St. John, and St. Peter and St.
Paul, each within a painted archway of reds and greens. Twelve shields
appear upon the chest, but on these remains no trace of the painted
bearings which would have told us the story of the piece. Below the
twelve shields, fessewise across the front of the chest runs a most
singular ornament, a broad band of open tracery cast in pewter. ¶ The
thirteenth century closes with the richly ornamented chest-fronts which
endure for the rest of the medieval period. The long chest in Saltwood
church is assigned by Mr. Roe to the century-end. The front is covered
with tracery work with deep mullions, the broad uprights at the ends
being filled with winged dragons in square panels. To this century-end
belongs also that most famous and glorious chest which is the pride
of the Musée Cluny, along whose mullioned front stand twelve knights
with shields and ailettes of their arms; and here again we feel that,
although the lighting of Mr. Roe’s photograph was unfortunate, our
modern illustrations must take the place of Viollet le Duc’s too highly
wrought drawings. ¶ Throughout the fourteenth century we find in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
England the traditional window tracery along the chest front, and the
dragons or beasts in squared compartments of the broad uprights. From
Hultoft, in Lincolnshire, we have in a late fourteenth-century chest
an early example of a panelled and buttressed piece, in which pierced
and cut-out tracery has been applied to a flush front. A lid painted
inside with shields of arms belongs to a chest formerly in the Chancery
court of Durham, and, apart from its beauty, claims our interest by the
fact that the first shield is that of the Aungerviles, of whom came
Richard of Bury, bishop of Durham, and author of the ‘Philobiblon,’ one
of those few mediaeval books which yet find readers. Concerning this
shield, we may remark that Mr. Roe’s ‘Gules, a cinquefoil <i>or</i> (or
argent) ermine pierced (of the field?)’ is not a very lucid piece of
blazonry. Between the shields a dragon meets with a centaur-like figure
in yellow hood and red kilt ‘running a tilt,’ as Mr. Roe somewhat
loosely phrases it, but really playing with the sword and buckler.
Forty-five years ago this chest was still in the Chancery court; if we
ask why it is now in the hands of an ‘eminent antiquary,’ we should
have for answer a familiar story of the ignorance and wanton folly of
our half-civilized English official classes. A sad side of Mr. Roe’s
narrative is the recurrent exclamation at the fact that a church
chest, perfect in the days of Parker, Cotman, or Shaw, is now staved
in, or clumsily restored. This in such cases where the chest has been
suffered to remain. The Wittersham chest does not seem to have stayed
at Wittersham long after its beauties had been published to the world
in a ‘Dictionary of Architecture,’ and the fact that the nameless
connoisseur who removed it took with him the ancient parish stocks as
well leaves Wittersham without the means of dealing with the offence
of those who should have been its custodians. Parker engraves a famous
chest at Guestling, of which but one panel remained when the present
rector came to Guestling, and even this poor relic has gone the way
of the rest. It would be well if the thief were the one enemy of such
treasures—in that case the nation might come to its own some day; but
the church stove, even in our own time, has crackled with fuel for the
loss of which our descendants will curse their pig-hearted ancestry.
¶ Of the most interesting type, which Mr. Roe, who shuns the English
word chest, is pleased to call a ‘tilting coffer,’ we are afforded a
valuable set of pictures. It is good to see that perhaps the finest
panel of St. George and his dragon and Dame Cleodolinde is in our own
national collection at South Kensington. The barbarously fine chest at
Ypres will stand to all who know it for a familiar example. Mr. Roe,
being possessed with the idea that these figured chests are English in
design and working, is persuaded that the Ypres chest may have been
abandoned by the English army which sieged Ypres in 1383; but we may
confess that we find no notably English feeling in this chest or its
fellows. ¶ To follow the story of the gothic chest to its running to
seed in the sixteenth century were to encroach upon the office of Mr.
Roe’s excellent monograph. Mr. Roe’s work is clear and to the point.
We feel that he has not only drawn and photographed, but handled and
rummaged the chests of which he tells us. He is cunning in hinges
and locks, and forgeries of respectable standing and the mis-datings
of long tradition do not entangle him. It may perhaps be said of his
terminology that he attaches too definite and settled a meaning to
the words which he chooses to apply to various forms of the objects
of his study. The definition of a coffer as ‘a box of great strength
for the keeping and transport of weighty articles, having its front
formed by a single panel,’ as distinct from a hutch, ‘a household
coffer of a rough description,’ strikes us as too assured and exact. A
more serious blemish arises from Mr. Roe’s apparent belief that from
the character of the work upon a chest one may easily guess whether
its first home were in church or hall. The familiar window tracery
of many chest-fronts spells for him plainly church or monastery. By
the same token Mr. Roe would have us set down for a churchman every
fourteenth-century man who wore ‘Poules windowes’ cut in his shoe
leather, and the knights and dragons of many miserere-seats would show
him that the first place of their setting-up was in the castle hall.
Another odd fancy of Mr. Roe’s persuades him that the ‘civil wars,’
apparently those of the king and commonwealth, account for the loss of
many pieces of English gothic furniture. Such a fancy does not argue an
intimate knowledge of the history of the seventeenth-century struggles,
than which no wars have been waged with less sacking and burning; and
Mr. Roe, as his last words show, knows full well that the fellest
enemies of our mediaeval relics flourished in the nineteenth century
in the close and the rectory, sat at high tables of old foundations,
and even came to good credit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span> as scholars and antiquaries. There are
honoured names amongst us to-day whose bearers have done deeds of
destruction to which Merciful Strickalthrow or Corporal Humgudgeon
would not have set their hands.</p>

<h3>A G<span class="smaller">UIDE TO</span> S<span class="smaller">IENA</span>:
H<span class="smaller">ISTORY AND</span> A<span class="smaller">RT</span>. By
William Heywood and Lucy Olcott. Enrico Torrini, Siena, 1903.</h3>

<p class="p0">Certainly it never rains but it pours. Siena, so long without any
adequate guide to her intensely interesting history and art, has
suddenly broken out into quite a literature to herself. Scarcely
has the controversy over the respective merits, or the reverse, of
Professor Langton Douglas’s ‘History’ and Mr. Gardner’s ‘Story’ ceased
to rouse our interest before a third guide appears in the field, which
to our mind is infinitely the best of the three. Less pretentious and
less costly, it contains in its smaller compass a mass of information
in a readable form that is within the comprehension of the dullest,
and yet worthy of the careful perusal of the most critical. Both Mr.
Heywood and Miss Olcott live in and love Siena, so that their several
parts are not only written <i>con amore</i>, but on carefully studied
data. The history is written with a swing that carries one along, and
yet leaves one at the end with a clear idea of what Siena was at her
best. Mr. Heywood’s charm of style—as might be expected from his
former work—is very great. It is easier, more lucid, and, without
being any the less expressive or forcible, is wholly free from the
few blemishes that might be objected to in his previous essays. No
one understands better than he the complications and kaleidoscopic
changes that occurred with so much abruptness in the government of
the republic. Therefore we have the more occasion to be grateful to
him for having set the main facts of her story before us, unhampered
by superfluous digressions and comments. Once only he pauses to give
eloquent expression to his admiration for that much-misunderstood and
much-abused body, the <i>Nove</i>, whose rule (1292–1355) was the
longest and most prosperous of all the various combinations that held
sway in Siena. They are usually represented as ruthless tyrants, and
generally detested and hateful; whereas there can be no question that
their firm, autocratic rule, if severe and sometimes cruel, held in
check alike arrogant noble and turbulent demagogue, and that under
their guidance Siena reached the highest point of her prosperity,
internal and external. At home flourished the arts of peace as they
never did again, and abroad her fame was European, her merchants were
respected, and her produce in demand throughout the civilized world.
With the fall of the <i>Nove</i> fell Siena. Their hold over the reins
of government lasted sixty-three years;—no other body again held
them so long until she finally sank into the position of a subject
city. Mr. Heywood’s notices as to the saints and writers of Siena are
all too brief, and we would like to hear more from him about them,
but space clearly forbids: and, as he points out, readers may turn
to his other works for much that is perforce left unrelated here. We
can only regret one note (on p. 68), which we feel must have been
inadvertent on his part, and certain expressions in the bibliographical
notice, to which we refer presently. ¶ Miss Olcott’s section, being,
we believe, her first literary work, deserves an unusually high meed
of praise. One may not always agree with her attributions, and her
judgement on painters that she does not like is severe and not always
quite just;—for example, her attitude towards Sodoma and Beccafumi,
respectively, will not be endorsed by all her readers;—still, she has
so evidently studied her subject with thoroughness and care, working
under the best direction, and weighing her facts with so much patience
and real insight, that one can scarcely praise this first essay of
hers too highly. Her attitude towards the native Sienese artists of
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is so truly devotional that,
even if it blinds her to the beauties and merits of later workers,
it disarms severe criticism. She points out very truly—and in this
respect she follows the same line as Mr. Heywood in his history—that
the art of Siena never rose again after the middle of the fourteenth
century (<i>i.e.</i>, contemporarily with the fall of the <i>Nove</i>)
to the point that it then attained. The various foreign influences
that eventually came into the state wrought fine achievements, but
native talent was never again what it had been in the days of Duccio,
Simone Martini, and their immediate successors. It is, however,
true that in the following century very great artists did arise, in
whose praise the authoress is specially eloquent. That she has great
reason, the lovely works of such men as Matteo di Giovanni, Neroccio
di Landi, Lorenzo di Pietro (Vecchietta), and Giovanni di Stefano
(Sassetta) amply testify to those who have eyes to see. To Neroccio
and Vecchietta, moreover, she draws further notice, since, like so
many artists of their day, they were both sculptors and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span> painters, and
obtained more than ordinary success in either of the greater arts.
Thus panel, bronze, and marble, when touched by them, produce effects
of exquisite charm in gracious line and lovely expression that are
unsurpassed and unsurpassable. We feel no doubt that to walk through
the city in Miss Olcott’s company will be a pleasure, which student and
traveller cannot fail to appreciate. That small mistakes as to fact
have occasionally crept in was of course unavoidable; but for practical
purposes they are unimportant. She has managed to avoid the dullness of
a mere record of facts, though her notes are full of practically useful
side-information; while, on the other hand, she has not fallen into
that temptation to dogmatize, so difficult to escape from when dealing
with a specialized school of painting like that of Siena. ¶ Student and
traveller alike have much reason to be grateful for the work; mainly on
account of its directness and simplicity; though also for the valuable
footnotes supplied by both authors. The bibliographical lists are of
great interest, but we cannot refrain from remarking that the notice as
to books to be avoided is, to say the least of it, in doubtful taste.
We understand the irritation caused by such books as those specified
to writers who have studied the subject carefully, and we recognize
fully the incalculable mischief done by the inaccuracies of the modern
catchpenny magazine contributor; but we cannot but think so long and
virulent an attack, however justly deserved, quite unsuitable within
the pages of a guide book. We suggest that in a future edition these
pages might be omitted, as being the only serious blemish to a book on
which authors and publisher may be very heartily congratulated.</p>

<p class="p0">The prospectus issued by the publisher of this work contained the
extraordinary statement that ‘E. T. Rogers Bey, in his contributions to
the subject, established beyond doubt that coats of arms and armorial
bearings were introduced into Europe by the crusaders in imitation of
the practice of the eastern princes whom they had encountered in the
field of battle.’ It would surprise no one acquainted with the vexed
question of heraldic ‘origins’ to know that he did nothing of the
kind. What he did advance was that ‘... les avis sont partagés sur la
question de savoir si les Croisés ont pulsé en Orient les notions
de cet art [blazon] ou s’il est exclusivement d’origine européenne.
Les arguments en faveur de son origine orientale me paraissent les
mieux fondés, car ils sont soutenus par des données historiques. Un
esprit militaire et même chevaleresque existait parmi les Musulmans
de l’Arabie, de la Syrie et de l’Égypte, longtemps avant la formation
de nos ordres de templiers et de chevaliers; et il est fort probable
que cet esprit guerrier s’est communiqué par l’entremise des Venitiens
et des Génois et repandu peu à peu en Europe même avant la première
croisade.’ We do not hesitate to say that beyond this string of theory
there is nothing in the forty-nine pages of Rogers Bey’s ‘Le Blason
chez les Princes Musulmans de l’Égypte et de la Syrie’ (Bulletin de
l’Institut Égyptien, 1880) offering proof of the derivation of European
armory from the east. All this we quote <i>in extenso</i> because Artin
Pasha’s work is, he states, to be regarded as the sequel to Rogers
Bey’s memoir, and because, where he touches the origin of western
heraldry, his remarks are likewise mere unfounded assertion. Neither
does his knowledge of European arms appear to be of the most accurate
order; he states that Louis IX of France was the first to adopt the
fleur de lys, when in fact the seal of that monarch’s father, Louis
VIII, bears a shield semé de lys, bearings which may be traced back to
the mantle and shoes worn by Philip Augustus at his ‘sacre’ in 1179,
similarly sown with fleurs de lys. Needless to say, the correctness of
no theory concerning the origin of European blazon is demonstrable,
and it is to be regretted that the author did not steer clear of it
altogether. As an account of Moslem blazon and of the emblems found
upon Arabic glass, pottery, sculpture, coins, metal-work and arms,
Artin Pasha’s work, in spite of such blemishes, will be of great
value to archaeologists and collectors. The author has been at pains
to obtain as complete a series as possible of the strange insignia
frequently figuring upon these works of art. His plan is to discuss the
bearings such as the fleur de lys, lion, fish, eagle, cup, dice, horns,
the so-called hieroglyphic signs, the sword and sabre, crescent, cross,
dagger, separately, each with its history, and a catalogue of extant
examples. Of these over three hundred are reproduced, many in colour,
from Egypt and the continental and London museums. Unfortunately many
are unidentified, and it seems to us that it would have increased
the value of the book if approximate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span> dates had been assigned to the
objects decorated with such insignia as remain for the present in this
category. The constitution of mameluke society, to which the majority
of mediaeval armigerous Egyptians belonged, is the great obstacle to
a systematic identification or study of their heraldry, if heraldry
it can be called. The cases in which insignia are known to have been
inherited are so few, says the author, that one cannot affirm that
hereditary blazon generally existed in Egypt, though in the case of
the emirs he concludes for the existence of transmission from father
to son; admittance to the mameluke body was closed, apparently, to
their legal offspring, and in the majority of cases their insignia
denoted official or court rank and changed with it. ¶ Artin Pasha gives
also a great deal of information concerning the emblems used by other
oriental nations, though his arguments seem occasionally to bring
within the net heraldic purely conventionalized animal or vegetable
forms, attributing to much merely symbolical or ornamental material a
character unwarranted by the strict significance of the term blazon.</p>

<p class="p0">This, the second and much enlarged edition of a volume published thirty
years ago and long out of print, contains the fruits of the author’s
researches, not only at Liége and in the Mosan towns, but also in many
museums and private collections. ¶ In the first fifty pages he has
brought together all the documentary evidence as to the introduction
and progress of art in the principality, illustrating the same by
reproductions of the paintings on the mutilated shrine of Saint Odilia
at Kerniel, of miniatures from manuscripts in the British Museum,
the Royal Library at Brussels, etc., and of the exquisite storied
embroideries on the antependium from the church of Saint Martin at
Liége, now in the Industrial Art Museum at Brussels. In the next three
chapters the author treats of the Benedictine artists of Liége, of the
Mosan contemporaries of the Van Eycks, and of the paintings executed
in the fifteenth century, of which so little has escaped destruction.
As to the painters who flourished in the sixteenth century there is
fuller information, though there yet remains much to be done before
the history of Joachim Patenir and Henry Bles can be cleared up and
their works classified. Of Lambert Lombard and his pupils and followers
the author gives us a full account, and from their time onwards to
the end of the eighteenth century this volume contains a thoroughly
complete history of the painters who flourished in the district and
of the paintings they executed. We congratulate the author on the
termination of this work, which, with the volume on sculpture and the
plastic arts published by him in 1890, constitutes a very satisfactory
and well-illustrated history of art in the principality of Liége.</p>

H<span class="smaller">EFT</span>.—The article of most general interest in the
current number is that by Drs. Ludwig and Bode on the picture of
the Resurrection recently acquired by the Berlin gallery from Count
Roncalli of Bergamo. The assumption that this is by Giovanni Bellini
himself rests on the following evidence: The church of St. Michael, on
the cemetery island of Venice, was so ruined in 1469 that the abbot
of the Camaldulensian house to which it belonged began to rebuild it.
In the year 1475 the patrician Marco Zorzi, of the Bertucci family,
obtained permission to build and furnish a family chapel in the church.
The chapel was dedicated to the Virgin, but in his mother’s will, dated
1479, it is already referred to as the chapel of the Resurrection. Then
follows the testimony of later writers. Sansovino, 1581, describing the
church, says, ‘La risurrezzione a olio fu del medisimo Gian Bellino.’
Ridolfi, 1648, describes the picture fully, and attributes it to
Bellini. Boschini, 1664, calls it a Cima, an attribution which clung to
the picture in St. Michael’s till 1810, when it disappeared. It will be
noted that there is hitherto no proof that the Roncalli picture stood
once in the chapel in question. That a composition of this kind by
Bellini existed was already to be guessed from various motives copied
in other pictures. The question remains whether this is the identical
picture, and not, as has been hitherto thought, a late version by
Basaiti, Previtali or Bartolommeo Veneto. On the other hand it is noted
that Ridolfi’s account of the picture is so minute that one may assume
that the Roncalli picture is either the actual one that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span> stood in
Zorzi’s chapel or an exact copy. The problem therefore resolves itself
into the question of whether the existing picture is a copy or not.
Drs. Ludwig and Bode are agreed that it is an original, and in spite
of some curious points which do not precisely agree with any other
existing Bellini we think they are right. The picture with which it has
most affinity is the Transfiguration at Naples, to which for various
reasons we may assign a date just a year or two previous to 1478, the
date of this work. If this is correct the likeness to Basaiti, Cima
and Bartolommeo Veneto is to be explained by the fact that this work
exercised a profound influence on the rising generation of Venetian
painters. It is to be noted also that we have here already the peculiar
honeycombed rock formation which the Vicentine painters, Montagna in
particular, afterwards employed. Whatever be the final verdict as to
the authorship of the work, the authorities of the Berlin gallery are
to be congratulated upon having secured one of the most imaginative
compositions in the whole range of Venetian art.—R. E. F.</p>

<p>Dr. Bode writes on the work of Hercules Segers, whose pictures, long
forgotten or ascribed to other masters, Rembrandt, Van Goyen, or
Vermeer of Haarlem, have recently been rediscovered, mainly through
the insight of Dr. Bode himself. The Berlin gallery has possessed
since 1874 the only signed picture hitherto known; another signed
work is now in the possession of Dr. Hofstede de Groot. These two, a
second landscape lately acquired by the Berlin gallery, and a picture
exhibited in London in 1901 under the name of Vermeer, but now the
property of Herr Simon, are reproduced. Other pictures discussed in the
text are a landscape ascribed to Rembrandt in the Uffizi and another,
also under Rembrandt’s name, in the National Gallery of Scotland.
A great part of the article is devoted to the etchings, the true
starting-point of all our knowledge of Segers. About sixty of these
are known, of which the Amsterdam cabinet has fifty, while very few
other collections possess any considerable number. Several admirable
facsimiles in colour accompany the article, and the interesting
announcement is made that a publication of the entire work of Segers is
contemplated, under the editorship of Prof. Jaro Springer. Almost all
the etchings are landscapes, generally printed in colour on a prepared
ground, and often finished by the artist with the brush. Dr. Bode
discusses the question whether the wild mountain scenery depicted in
most of them was invented by the artist or true to nature, and decides
for the latter alternative. A great curiosity is the etching in colours
of the Lamentation for Christ, copied by Segers from a wood-cut by Hans
Baldung. An excellent reproduction is given of the impression recently
acquired by the Berlin cabinet. Dr. Bode does not mention the fact that
an impression was already known in the collection of King Frederick
Augustus II at Dresden, where it passed for a drawing by Baldung till
its true character was discerned some years ago by Prof. Lehrs.</p>

<p class="right mright2">C. D.</p>

<p>L’A<span class="smaller">RTE</span>. Parts I–IV. 1903.—The publication of <i>L’Arte</i>,
suspended owing to a strike at Rome, has been resumed, and we have
received the first four parts for the current year. Signor Venturi
appears to have finally discovered the authorship of the small
bronze doors which close the reliquary containing St. Peter’s keys
in S. Pietro in Vincoli. These, which have been variously praised as
Pollajuolo’s and disparaged as Filarete’s, are really not Florentine
at all, but by the Milanese Caradosso, working doubtless under
Florentine influence. There are two replicas of the two bas reliefs on
the doors in question. Both, though alike in the general composition,
are curiously modified in some essential particulars which render
the subjects unintelligible. One of these replicas is in the Louvre,
where it is attributed to the Florentine school; the other, in the
Victoria and Albert Museum, is more rashly ascribed to Lorenzo
Ghiberti, to whose style it does not conform at all. ¶ M. Marcel
Reymond solves satisfactorily a puzzling question connected with the
tomb of Onofrio Strozzi in the church of Sta. Trinità in Florence.
This has been ascribed on documentary evidence to Piero di Niccolò,
who was supposed to have executed it in 1418. In 1423 Piero di Niccolò
executed at Venice the essentially gothic monument of Doge Mocenigo,
while Donatello himself only arrived at a conception like that of
the Strozzi tomb in his monument of Giovanni de’ Medici in 1429. On
stylistic grounds there can be no doubt that the Strozzi tomb is nearly
a decade later than the Medici tomb, and yet the documentary evidence
has been hitherto allowed as authoritative. On closer examination,
however, this appears to be quite inconclusive; it is a warning of
the necessity for re-examining documents in the light of the evidence
afforded by style. The Strozzi tomb may be safely considered to be no
earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span> than the close of the fourth decade of the century. It is
either, M. Reymond thinks, by Donatello himself, or by some sculptor
who carried out a design by him. ¶ The remains of Pisan domination in
Sardinia are the subject of researches by Signor Dionigi Scano, who
has had the good fortune to discover at Oristano a signed statue by
Nino Pisano, together with a number of bas reliefs in which he traces
Pisan influence. The very crude architectural settings of most of
these, however, betray a strain of northern influence. Far finer than
these are the thirteenth-century lion-head door handles in bronze which
he reproduces. ¶ Dr. Seidlitz returns to the question of Zenale and
Buttinone <i>à propos</i> of Signor Malaguzzi Valeri’s interesting book
on Lombard painters. He points out the impossibility of supposing,
as Signor Valeri does, that the Castelbarco altarpiece in the Brera
belongs to the fifties. The supposed 5 of the date must be a mutilated
8. In the main, however, he appears to have come independently to
similar conclusions about the respective shares of Buttinone and Zenale
in the great Treviglio altarpiece. He calls attention to the important
picture by Zenale (the Circumcision) in the Louvre overlooked by the
Italian writer, but by far the most interesting suggestion that he
makes is that the strangely imaginative composition of the Adoration in
the Ambrosian Library which Morelli described as an early Bramantino is
by Buttinone himself. It must be admitted that in no other work does
that artist display a freedom and originality of invention comparable
to this, but the likenesses to his peculiarly uncouth style are
certainly striking. We should like to call attention to the fact that
most of these ideas were suggested some years ago by Mr. Herbert Cook
in his catalogue to the Lombard exhibition at the Burlington Fine Arts
Club. Both Dr. Seidlitz and Signor Valeri are acquainted with this
work, but neither has had the courtesy to make full acknowledgement
of Mr. Cook’s priority. ¶ Signor Francesco La Grassa-Patti writes on
the works of the Della Robbia in Sicily. The full-length Madonna at
Trapani he attributes to Andrea, though the coarse vigorous forms
suggest Giovanni while still working in his father’s style as more
likely. The work is described as Giovanni’s by Miss Cruttwell. The
second is a tondo at Messina (Sta. Maria della Scala) which Miss
Cruttwell describes as a school piece. This also is attributed by
Signor Grassa-Patti to Andrea, while the one work for which Andrea’s
authorship might be claimed, the Madonna del Cuscino at Palermo, is
called a school piece. A fourth work is the Adoration in the church
of S. Niccolò lo Gurgo at Palermo. This M. Reymond considers to be
one of many replicas of the motive. The author makes no mention of
Miss Cruttwell’s exhaustive researches, although, with the exception
of the last, all these works have been fully and critically treated
by her. ¶ Signor Gino Fogolari describes some wooden sculptures of
the twelfth century at Carsoli and Alatri. Those at the latter place
comprise a magnificent Madonna and Child, one of the finest specimens
of the type which was usual in Italian sculpture of this period, and
twelve has reliefs of the doors which originally closed the Madonna’s
shrine. These are of interest as still possessing some of the original
colouring and for their similarity in technique to the ivory work
of the period. ¶ Dr. Romualdi describes an admirable plan which has
been formed for making a complete <i>catalogue raisonné</i> of all
publications on the history of Italian art. The scheme is to treat the
subject by means of regional committees, whose work will be united and
revised by central committees at Florence and Rome. The importance of
such a catalogue in a subject of which the literature has become so
unwieldy cannot be overrated: the scheme deserves every encouragement.
¶ Signor Venturi replies at length to Dr. Julius von Schlosser’s
views concerning the sketch-book attributed to Giusto of Padua in the
National Gallery of Engravings at Rome, maintaining the correctness
of his original attribution. ¶ Among the ‘miscellanea’ there are
descriptions of a fourteenth-century pastoral staff in the cathedral
at Treviso, which Signor Biscaro attributes to a Venetian goldsmith.
He seems scarcely to explain the peculiarly French character of most
of the forms. ¶ Signor Venturi gives a description with a collotype
reproduction of the newly-discovered Jacopo di Barbari at Naples. It
is evidently a striking picture in which the influence of Antonello da
Messina strongly predominates. The two men represented in it are Luca
Pacioli, the celebrated mathematician, and the artist himself, whose
apparent age agrees with that indicated by the inscription, namely,
twenty years. This, since the picture bears the date 1495, throws a
new light on Barbari’s position in Venetian art. Signor Venturi also
reproduces a drawing in the Piancastelli collection at Rome, which
appears to be the original work by Timoteo Viti of which the head in
the Taylorian at Oxford, hitherto thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span> to be an original, is a
replica. If the reproductions are to be trusted, there can be no doubt
about the superiority of the Roman drawing. Signor Toesca attributes
the coarse picture of the Coronation of the Virgin in the Naples
gallery (there ascribed to Matteo di Giovanni) to Christoforo Scacco.
He also reproduces an Antoniazzo Romano in the depôt of the Uffizi.
Signor Venturi maintains in a vehement but unconvincing argument his
former opinion that the Resurrection which the Berlin gallery acquired
recently from Count Roncalli at Bergamo is not by Giovanni Bellini, but
by Bartolommeo Veneto. ¶ Signor P. D’Achiardi publishes a picture which
is in the house of the cathedral chaplains at Pisa which has hitherto
been supposed to be merely a school piece of Benozzi Gozzoli’s atelier,
but which a recent restoration has shown to be worthy of the master. It
is dated 1470, and is therefore one of the earliest of his Pisan works.
Signor Manceri adduces a document which shows that Pietro di Bontate,
who was supposed to have assisted Laurana in his works at Palermo, was
not an artist but a stonemason.</p>

<p>G<span class="smaller">AZETTE DES</span> B<span class="smaller">EAUX</span>
A<span class="smaller">RTS</span>, June.—M. Henri Cochin begins, in
‘Some reflections on the Salons,’ a delightful article which is none
the worse for containing very little about the pictures and a good deal
of general speculation about the aims which modern art has proposed
to itself. He regrets that the present moment is one in which the
public has to some extent lost confidence in its own omniscience,
and that the artists are without any clearly formulated ideals to
arouse their devotion or hatred. ¶ Owing to the activity of M. Paul
Meurice, Paris is going to have yet another museum, that of Victor
Hugo. In what was once the poet’s house in the Place Royale, there
have been collected and arranged all kinds of records and mementos of
the poet-politician’s career. Not the least important of these are the
pen-and-ink drawings in which he often made the first record of scenes,
elaborated afterwards in prose or verse. It is to these slight but by
no means insignificant performances that M. Emile Berteaux devotes
a serious study. There was, in fact, a time when Victor Hugo nearly
turned artist; he got so far as to master the processes of etching
and to produce one successful plate. But he realized the danger of
this parergon interfering with his real work and never repeated the
experiment. Nevertheless, to the end of his life he noted ideas or
striking effects in pen-drawings of astonishing force and brilliance,
on which he smudged a melodramatic chiaroscuro with a finger dipped in
ink or coffee. The results cannot be treated as great works of art, but
none the less every one of them proclaims the man of genius; nor are
they unimportant for the understanding of Victor Hugo’s development,
since the sombre mood of his later poems was already foreshadowed in
these hasty improvisations. ¶ M. Moreau-Nélaton describes the genesis
of one of Corot’s late works, the view of Sin-le-noble, now forming
part of the Thomy-Thiéry bequest to the Louvre. M. Denis Roche begins
an account of Dmitri Grigorévitch Lévitski, a little-known Russian
portraitist of the eighteenth century, whose works have decided merit.
A certain influence of contemporary Venetian art is apparent in his
composition, but for the most part he was formed under the influence
of French artists like Tocqué, whom the Empress Elizabeth invited
to Russia in the middle of the century. The portrait of Diderot
by Lévitski, which is reproduced here, shows that his feeling for
character was keener than the average run of West European painters of
his time. It is comparable to a Chardin rather than any of the more
mannered masters of the day.</p>

<p>R<span class="smaller">ASSEGNA D</span>’A<span class="smaller">RTE</span>,
June.—Signor Carlo Gamba describes two works
of art in the royal villa of Castello; one, a Florentine picture (a
Nativity) of about 1460, in which the influence of Baldovinetti is
most apparent; the other a polychrome stucco attributed to Agostino
di Duccio. The composition is undoubtedly his, but the type of face
is longer and more accented than is usual with that master. ¶ Signor
Antonio Gobbo points out the great differences between the ancient
methods of mosaic work and those which obtain in the modern factories
at Venice and elsewhere. He insists rightly on the necessity of doing
the mosaic <i>in situ</i>, instead of reversed on a cartoon, on the
desirability of a restricted colour-scheme and of a less mechanically
even fabrication of the tesserae. It is interesting to have explained
thus the extreme discomfort one experiences in front of most modern
mosaics. ¶ Signor Annoni describes some remains of fifteenth-century
work in the northern suburb of Milan, the most interesting being
a fresco which he attributes to Borgognone at Garignano. ¶ Signor
Antonio della Rovere endeavours to prove by Morellian methods that a
feeble and late sixteenth-century Venetian picture, representing St.
Jerome, is by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span> none other than Giorgione. As he relies for his proof
on the attribution to Giorgione of the Three Ages in the Pitti, and a
well-known Torbido in the Venice academy, his extraordinary result is
not entirely the fault of the method he employs. ¶ The Antonello da
Messina of Christ at the Column in the museum at Piacenza is reproduced
in this number. It is evidently a work of the highest importance for
our knowledge of this great and still scarcely understood master. In
conception and execution alike it surpasses all the numerous works by
Solario and others that it inspired.</p>

<p>T<span class="smaller">HE </span> A<span class="smaller">RCHITECTURAL</span>
R<span class="smaller">EVIEW</span>, June, contains an account of
Orvieto cathedral by Mr. Langton Douglas. He effectively disparages
Commendatore Fumi’s theory that the original design for the church
which follows the plan of a Roman basilica was by Arnolfo di Cambio,
and attributes it to ‘some mediocre master of the conservative Roman
school.’ With regard to the façade and the importance of Lorenzo
Maitano’s work at Orvieto he is in accordance with Burckhardt and Bode.
He has done a real service to students in reproducing the two beautiful
designs of the façade by the great Sienese master. In discussing the
sculptures of the façade he shows excellent reasons for assuming, as
was already done by Burckhardt and Bode, that Maitano was the master
sculptor. We are rather surprised to find him however admitting M.
Marcel Reymond’s contention that Andrea da Pontedera also had a hand in
the work, though at a much earlier date than that writer supposed. The
work, we think, is throughout thinner, slighter, and of a more facile
elegance than the known works of Andrea Pisano. Mr. Langton Douglas
tends to exaggerate the indifference of previous writers to Sienese
sculpture: the list of works which he gives, with the remark that they
have ‘entirely escaped the notice of M. Reymond and other writers upon
Tuscan sculpture,’ is more completely given in Bode’s ‘Italienische
Plastik’. ¶ For the rest the <i>Architectural Review</i> is devoted to
contemporary works, among which we may call attention to Mr. Gilbert
Scott’s remarkable designs for the Liverpool Cathedral competition. We
may hope that even now it is not too late for the committee to revise
their verdict and give us the chance of seeing the execution of a
really vital and original gothic design.</p>

<p>The May number of the <span class="smcap">Emporium</span> (<span class="smcap">Bergamo</span>) which
did not reach us in time for our last issue contains an interesting
account by Signor Frizzoni of the Tadini gallery at Lovere. The
gallery which, with the immense modern palace that contains it, was
left to the remote little town of Lovere by Count Tadini, has, it
must be admitted, a very small proportion of notable works, but since
Signor Frizzoni has rearranged it, its value for the lover of art is
considerably enhanced. It is no longer necessary to wander through
innumerable seventeenth-century copies in order to pick out the few
works that demand serious attention. And these few are indeed of such
excellence that no one need regret the time spent in coasting up the
winding shores of the Lake of Iseo in order to visit it. By far the
most remarkable of these is the incomparable Jacopo Bellini of the
Madonna and Child, perhaps the finest existing work of this rare
master. Besides this there is Bordone’s greatest masterpiece, a Madonna
and Child enthroned with SS. Christopher and George below—a work of
almost Giorgionesque splendour, though it is needless to say more
florid in taste and more agitated in line. The curtain suspended behind
by flying putti reminds one for a moment of Lotto’s S. Bernardino
altarpiece. Another fine picture is the portrait of a knight by
Parmigiano, while in a picture which the catalogue describes as ‘un
bellissimo quadro di Pietro Perugino,’ it is possible to recognize the
forms of an early Veronese master, probably Domenico Morone himself. We
can only hope that the trustees of the Tadini bequest will carry out
Signor Frizzoni’s suggestion and have this picture, which has suffered
from clumsy repainting, restored so far as possible to its original
condition. An early Venetian picture, falsely signed Cornelio Fiore,
and attributed, quite rightly we think, to Lorenzo Veneziano by the
author, and a crudely-painted Pietà, signed by Girolamo da Treviso, are
other original works.</p>

<p>We have received from Messrs. P. and D. Colnaghi &amp; Co. an impression
of a mezzotint by Mr. H. Scott Bridgwater after Raeburn’s portrait of
Mrs. Home Drummond of Blair Drummond, which they have just published.
Raeburn loses nothing in Mr. Bridgwater’s translation, indeed the
mezzotint has greater merit as a work of art than the original picture;
we have seen no modern engraving in mezzotint which we can regard as
its equal. Mr. Bridgwater has produced a work worthy to rank with the
best mezzotint engraving of the eighteenth century—with the work
even of such a master of the art as J. R. Smith; and this portrait of
Mrs. Drummond is very much superior to some of the eighteenth-century
mezzotints for which absurd prices are being paid by people who regard
everything that comes from the eighteenth century with indiscriminating
admiration. We do not believe that anyone of taste and judgement, who
was not blinded by the eighteenth-century glamour, could seriously
maintain that any mezzotint of Valentine Green’s is to be compared as
a work of art with Mr. Bridgwater’s latest work. We have little enough
to boast of in modern artistic production; let us at least recognize
good work when we meet with it; the best work of modern artists has
been done in black and white, and most of the modern works of art that
are really worth collecting are drawings or etchings; to these we can
now add some mezzotints, among which Mr. Bridgwater’s Mrs. Drummond is
perhaps the most notable. The issue is restricted to 350 impressions,
all artist’s proofs.</p>

<p class="p0">S<span class="smaller">IR</span>,</p>

<p>One of your subscribers in Venice has drawn my attention to an article
in your magazine (April number, p. 185), written by Mr. Herbert Cook,
and illustrating a magnificent portrait by Titian, in the possession
of Mr. Julius Wernher. Your subscriber tells me that similarly
insufficiently described Italian portraits are not uncommon in English
private collections, though, of course, not through the fault of the
collectors, as it is impossible to obtain sufficient information from
printed books only. We here in Venice are naturally better off, and
the public and private archives and the manuscripts in the libraries
offer much material to one who is experienced to handle it, and yield
in most cases sufficient information. So your subscriber has asked me
to show in the case of this Giacomo Doria what we can achieve here. ¶
To the student of palaeography it is not a matter of opinion, but of
certainty, that the inscription reads: Giacomo Doria <i>quondam</i>
Agostini, that means Giacomo Doria, son of the late Agostino. The
dress is not the habit of an Augustinian friar. In the famous concert
by Giorgione, in the Palazzo Pitti, the ecclesiastic playing the
clavi-cembalo is an Augustinian;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span> he is clean shaven, has the large
tonsure, and wears a mozetta. It is impossible to decide by looking at
the reproduction alone whether Giacomo wears Venetian or Genoese dress,
everything being entirely black. According to Crollalanza’s ‘Dizionario
storico-blasonico,’ there were two families of the name of Doria—one
in Genoa, and one in the Veneto. Mr. Cook has not been able to decide
to which branch Giacomo belonged. ¶ Now Signor Comm. Carlo dei Conti
Bullo, at Venice, has a private archive containing many important
documents concerning the history of the town of Chioggia. These
documents show that the war between Venice and Genoa, called the war of
Chioggia, led to the settlement of several important Genoese families
in Chioggia. Amongst these are mentioned the Bonivento, the Cibo, the
Gandolfo and the Doria. ¶ The Chioggia branch of the Doria family
still exists; its present head is Signor Giovanni Battista Doria, a
draughtsman in the Genio Civile in Venice. This gentleman has in his
possession a genealogical tree, compiled and signed by two canons of
the cathedral of Chioggia, which proves his descent from Victor, son of
Giovanni, born in the year 1480, and founder of the Chioggia branch.
But in this tree no Giacomo di Agostino occurs. Now Signor Doria has
another tree, although not a signed one, which shows how Victor di
Giovanni is attached to the main trunk of the family in Genoa. In this
tree the looked-for Giacomo di Agostino occurs; he is therefore a
Genoese and not a Venetian. ¶ We give here the interesting part of this
tree:</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe30" id="genealogy">
  <img class="w100" src="images/genealogy.png" alt="Genealogy of Giacomo di Agostino">
</div>

<p>We see from this tree that Giacomo was a man of eminence, a brother
of a doge, and the father of two doges of the republic of Genoa. His
personality is of particular interest to the Germans, as his nearest
relations play an important part in Schiller’s great tragedy, ‘The
Conspiracy of Fiesco.’ His cousins Vettor and Nicolò settled in
Chioggia, and, probably on the occasion of a visit to his relatives,
Titian painted his portrait. Signor Doria is not certain as to the
signification of the dates occurring in this tree, probably they mean
the year of birth. Mr. Cook puts the portrait about the year 1523, but
I am afraid it will have to be put to a considerably later date. ¶
This is all we can do in Venice; for further information about Giacomo
one would have to search the documents in the archives of Genoa.
¶ Curiously enough, Mr. Cook has not a word to say about the arms
which one can faintly recognize in the upper left-hand corner of the
reproduction. I give below the arms of the Genoese Dorias, and those
of the Dorias of Chioggia. ¶ From what I am able to make out, the arms
represented on the picture are the Genoese arms. I shall be happy to
search for arms occurring on Italian portraits in English collections,
and collect information about the persons represented, if printed books
fail to give the necessary help.</p>

CHAFFERS is responsible for the spread of a theory regarding
the Lowestoft factory and its productions, which, after it had been
provisionally endorsed by the majority of collectors, turned out to
be one of the worst mystifications recorded in ceramic history. It
must be conceded, in mitigation of the offence, that seldom had such
a crop of apparently admissible evidence turned up to substantiate
an ill-grounded belief. ¶ On a visit that the author of ‘Marks and
Monograms,’ in quest of information, paid to the town of Lowestoft,
he came across numerous pieces of porcelain of very distinctive
character, bearing the crest or initials of the old families in which
they had long been preserved, and all of which were said by their
possessors to have been made in the local factory that existed at
one time. He concluded, naturally enough, that he was on the way
to the discovery of a most important and so far unsuspected centre
of production—a too-hasty conclusion that a prejudiced course of
investigation, unfortunately, came to strengthen. ¶ The ware that he
soon felt himself warranted to call ‘Lowestoft porcelain’ bore, it
is true, decorations of European design, but was no other than the
inferior oriental china that the East India companies threw wholesale
upon the market during the eighteenth century. In building up his lame
theory Chaffers had neglected to take into consideration a few points
of primary importance. ¶ All the ancient inhabitants of the town who
could remember anything of the extinct factory agreed in saying that
it was a small place, with only one biscuit oven and one enamelling
kiln, and that at the best of times the number of persons it employed
did not exceed seventy. Now, if the inquirer had not willingly lost
sight of the fact that the very same kind of porcelain as that of
which he was endeavouring to localize the origin was commonly found in
every country which had had commercial intercourse with the east, not
only in Europe, but also in America—where Boston and Salem were the
centres of a large importation trade—and that many ancient families
inhabiting the sea-port towns of those countries boast the possession
of tea or dinner services of similar china, emblazoned with the arms
or inscribed with the initials of an ancestor who had obtained them
from the East Indies; if he had not conveniently forgotten that odd
specimens of the ware are found in every collection and curiosity shop
at home and abroad, then he might have suspected that such a colossal
supply could only have come from a manufacturing centre of amazing
magnitude, and not from a small factory at work for a few years on the
coast of England. He also failed to observe that the paste of the china
was manifestly of oriental character, and that there is no record of
hard porcelain having ever been made at Lowestoft. ¶ On the other hand,
a coarse kind of soft china, usually painted in underglaze blue, has
been traced as the undeniable product of the Lowestoft factory, and
a sufficient number of examples of that class can now be produced to
dispel any doubt as to the precise description of the ware that was
made there, and to put an end to all controversy. ¶ To the facility
that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span> situation of Lowestoft offered for trading with Holland by
way of Yarmouth must be attributed the existence of a petty company
of merchants who joined to the importation of Delft-faïence the
manufacture, on a small scale, of a pottery of the same description.
White and blue faïence pieces, inscribed with local names and dated
as early as 1755, seem to indicate that the pottery-works were in
operation about that time. The making of soft china was added shortly
afterwards. A heap of discarded plaster moulds was unearthed from
the site of the old works in 1902; it included moulds for embossed
sauce-boats and plain globular teapots; upon one of these latter, the
date 1762 was incised in the plaster. The globular tea-pot made in
that mould is reproduced on the accompanying plate. In the same year a
queer, nine-sided ink-pot was manufactured; it bears a pseudo-Chinese
ornamentation in underglaze blue, with the monogram ‘R.B. 1762.’ Robert
Browne, for whom the piece was painted and inscribed, was the head of
the firm till 1771. This unimpeachable testimony of the true style
of the Lowestoft fabrication is now in the possession of Mr. Arthur
Crisps, in whose collection are preserved six other ink-pots of the
same shape, together with many other genuine pieces, decorated in the
same manner, and bearing dates ranging from 1762 to 1782. Among these
may be mentioned a tea service which has the name ‘Eliza<sup>th</sup> Buckle,’
and the date 1768, painted in blue. It was executed by Robert Allen, a
nephew of the worthy dame, who was still serving his apprenticeship,
but in after times became the manager of the works. Also a number of
small articles bearing the words ‘A trifle from Lowestoft’ or ‘A trifle
from Yarmouth.’ None of these specimens have anything in common with
the so-called Lowestoft china. ¶ A family tradition discloses the way
in which porcelain making was introduced at Lowestoft. It is reported
that Robert Browne, anxious to master a process unknown to him and
from which he expected great results, repaired to London disguised as
a workman, and in that capacity took employment in one of the china
factories, either Bow or Chelsea. The discipline of former years had
somewhat relaxed in these establishments, and he had no difficulty
in worming out from one of the foremen, in exchange for adequate
remuneration, the secret of the mixture, with instructions about
practical manipulations. The object he had in view appears to have been
most easily attained; scarcely three weeks had elapsed when he returned
to his own works, provided with sufficient information to start
china-making at once, without calling any outsider to his assistance.
It is needless to observe that what he learned in this manner did not
put him in the position of producing hard porcelain, and that he could
not have made any on this basis. ¶ As it stands now the history of
the Lowestoft works is a short one to tell. A better knowledge of the
exact nature of the owners’ business might have been obtained from an
examination of the papers and account books of the old firm; they may
or may not be still in existence; at any rate, their contents have
never been investigated. We know very little besides the fact that
fritt porcelain was made for the first time in 1762, and that the
factory was closed in 1803. This article will, however, have fulfilled
its purpose if it establishes, once for all, not so much what was the
true Lowestoft ware, but what it was not. One may well wonder how it
came to pass that the name of the obscure Lowestoft factory could ever
have been mentioned in connection with a particular ware which, in
every country where the unmistakable specimens of it are met with in
large quantities, is recognized as being of oriental provenance. As
no conjecture has so far been advanced in answer to that query I will
venture to present a not improbable solution of the problem.</p>

<p>That they never manufactured such a porcelain at Lowestoft has no longer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
to be demonstrated; it remains to be proved that they sold it, and
that the misconception as to its origin arose from no other cause.
We must remember, in the first instance, that the proprietors of the
works were also ship-owners, conducting a small trade with Holland.
They exported English clays and raw materials for the use of the Delft
potters, and brought back, in return, articles of Dutch faïence,
often painted with names and inscriptions, for which they accepted
commissions from private customers. We know, next, that Rotterdam
was the centre of the mighty commerce carried on between Holland and
China. It may, then, be fairly assumed that while engaged in the
trade of common Delft ware, they conceived the idea of entering into
communication with the wholesale importers of Chinese porcelain from
whom they could purchase large supplies, and establishing in England a
highly-remunerative branch of business by underselling the East India
company. ¶ It was customary with the Dutch firms to send over to their
foreign settlements shapes and designs obtained from European sources,
to be reproduced by native hands. Models from Dresden, Sèvres, and even
from Leeds or the Staffordshire potteries, were constantly copied in
oriental porcelain. The Lowestoft people did what all other merchants
had done before them, and through the same channel forwarded to China
the designs of coats-of-arms, English mottoes, and initials that were
to be painted on the porcelain they had undertaken to supply. In the
Henry Willett collection is an armorial plate decorated in the usual
Indo-European style, and inscribed, at the back, with its certificate
of origin: CANTON <span class="smaller">IN</span> CHINA 24th Jan. 1791. Commissions of
that kind were received from the leading families of the neighbourhood
and duly executed; hence the number of local patronymics that Chaffers
noticed on the porcelain in the possession of many inhabitants of the
town, who honestly believed that it had been made by the very men from
whom it had been purchased. ¶ In 1770 the business had taken sufficient
extension to induce the partners to open a warehouse in Queen Street,
Cheapside. Their agent, Clark Dunford, inserted in the London papers
an announcement in which he advertised ‘a large selection of Lowestoft
china.’ We possess no information as to what may have been the exact
description of the goods advertised under that name, but we may safely
surmise that it was something superior to ‘A trifle from Lowestoft’
or any of the articles we know to have been the staple production of
the works. It seems that a more attractive exhibition might have been
formed in the show-room by a stock of Chinese porcelain imported by
the Lowestoft company. ¶ I feel convinced that conclusive proofs of
this elucidation of the Lowestoft puzzle will one day come to light;
in the meantime, it cannot be denied that it is strongly supported
by the following facts: It is recorded, on good authority, that the
ruin of the company was caused by the wreck of one of their vessels
carrying a cargo of porcelain, and the burning, by the French army,
of the warehouse they had established at Rotterdam. The idea that
the enormous amount of ware required to load a vessel and to fill
a large warehouse in Rotterdam, not to speak of the one in London,
could have been supplied by a one-oven factory, is too ludicrous to be
entertained for one moment, and it may be dismissed without further
comment. ¶ It has been suggested that the Lowestoft painters may have
decorated ware imported from China in the white. By reason of the
ubiquity of the porcelain decorated in the accredited style, and the
small number of hands employed at the factory, such a suggestion is
equally untenable. A hard porcelain teapot, unmistakably painted by a
Chinese hand, which is marked ‘Allen, Lowestoft,’ is reproduced on the
opposite page. Robert Allen was manager of the works up to the last.
When they closed he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span> set up a small china shop in the town, decorating
himself part of the articles he sold. His supply was drawn from various
sources, including oriental. Far from being deceived by such misleading
testimonies, we may only infer from this tea-pot that the dealer was
wont to affix his name to all that passed through his hands, even upon
such pieces as had been decorated abroad. This curious specimen is now
in the Victoria and Albert museum. ¶ The so-called Lowestoft style is
characterized by sprays and garlands of flowers, in which two peculiar
pink and purple colours play a conspicuous part, and by scalloped
borders of the scale or trellis patterns. Similar designs appear on
the early china and earthenware of Staffordshire. The last partisans
of the Chaffers theory—for all the offshoots of the mystification
have not yet been fully eradicated—believe that such pieces afford
irrefutable examples of the Lowestoft original production. This is
an error that must be discarded with the others. To imitate Chinese
decoration has always been the golden rule of the English potter; just
as he had reproduced the fine Nankin porcelain, he also copied the
quasi-European ware manufactured for exportation by the East India
company, and this all the more readily that it could be easily and
cheaply produced. The well-known scale borders and the sprays of pink
and purple roses occur frequently on the early china of Minton, Spode
and other makers. These designs were obviously taken from the Chinese
importations, and did not originate in the Potteries any more than
they originated at Lowestoft. ¶ From the few authenticated specimens
that have come under the collector’s notice we gather that the paste
of the genuine Lowestoft porcelain is coarse, semi-opaque, and of a
dingy white; the glaze is speckled with bubbles and minute black spots,
which denote a rather imperfect manufacture. It is poorly decorated,
and under these conditions we understand that it was not preciously
preserved in the households; at all events, it has now become very
rare. No mark was ever used at the factory, and the specific character
of the ware is not sufficiently pronounced to allow us to use such
undoubted examples as we possess as a means of identifying those which
may have escaped destruction.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hide-first2">A</span>BOUT
the middle of the year 1543, somewhere between June 20 and 25, a
meeting of Paul III and Charles V was arranged at Busseto between Parma
and Cremona with a view to the settlement of the political differences
outstanding at that date. In the train of the pope came Titian, who
on every occasion when the emperor set foot on Italian soil took the
opportunity of paying his addresses to the monarch. On this occasion,
too, the emperor had a commission for him; Titian was instructed to
paint a portrait of the dead empress. From Aretino’s letters—which,
apart from their personal fascination which no reader of them is
able to resist, are second to none as a source of information on the
life of the great painter—a few further details of the incident are
to be gleaned, for some days later Aretino, in the company of Duke
Guidobaldo of Urbino and of the Venetian ambassadors, met the emperor
near Peschiera in the course of his journey to Germany. It was one
of the red letter days in Messer Pietro’s life, and, fulfilled with
vain-glory, he was never tired of talking of the marked consideration
wherewith, if his chronicle is to be trusted, the emperor received him.
On this occasion, when portraiture became the topic of conversation,
Charles referred to the portrait of his wife that he had given to
Titian at Busseto, and told Aretino to tell his godfather that it was
a very good likeness, though the work of a painter of small merit.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
From Aretino’s letters we glean further particulars. In October 1544
he addresses a letter to the emperor wherein he extols the completed
picture in such high-flown phrases as to baffle translation.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> ‘In
defiance of Death, he has called her back to life by the inspiration
of his colours, so that God possesses her for the first, Charles for
the second time.’ Although his words sound as if he were speaking of a
finished picture, Titian, it would appear, did not dispatch the picture
to the emperor until about a year later. In October 1545 he informed
the monarch that he had handed the two portraits at which he had been
working with all the diligence of which he was capable, over to Mendoza
to be forwarded.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> A few months later he was writing again from Rome,
whither he had gone at the bidding of the Farnesi, to say that he had
delivered his own portrait of the empress, ‘together with the other
which had been given to me to copy,’ to Don Diego.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> And he adds: ‘If
I hear that it finds favour I shall feel the greatest satisfaction; but
in the contrary event, I should prefer to improve it in such a manner
as to content your majesty if our Lord God vouchsafes me to be able to
come to bring a picture of Venus by me,’ etc. ¶ A little more than two
years later Titian arrived at Augsburg at the summons of the emperor,
who on this occasion wished once again to see himself portrayed by
his favourite painter, this time as the conqueror of the Protestant
princes, uplifted and on horseback. It involved a long sojourn.
Towards the end of it, on September 1, 1548, Titian wrote to Granvella
to explain his prospects to him, and in this letter enumerates the
pictures he had done for the emperor, among them ‘The empress alone
and the one of the emperor and empress.’ Here a little difficulty
arises. Has Titian then painted a single portrait of the empress on two
occasions, one between 1543 and 1545, the other in 1548? Or, on the
other hand, is the work referred to in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span> letter one and the same
with the earlier portrait, and did Titian, as a matter of fact, work
it up again? It is impossible to speak with any degree of certainty,
but as the Spanish inventories always speak of one portrait only we may
assume that the latter hypothesis is the more likely to be correct. ¶
While the double portrait has been lost, the picture of the empress
has found a place in that incomparable collection of Titian’s works
which the Prado gallery in Madrid comprises. It is one of Titian’s
most important works; perhaps, indeed, it takes the first place among
his portraits of women. Never is his taste more exquisite than here.
Its courtly splendour strikes one as a matter of course. In the midst
of glorious colour—red and white—the pale, somewhat colourless
face stands out framed by its fair reddish hair; the hand clasps a
breviary. A window to the right opens on a landscape scene, one of
those glimpses of Nature such as Titian had the secret of conjuring
up with his brush with such incomparable art. No one looking at the
picture would ever be able to suspect how it was painted; that its
painter had never seen his model with his own eyes. It was no uncommon
thing, by the way, for Titian to paint the portraits of people whom he
did not even know by sight. He was proud of his skill of being able to
recognize the characteristic traits of a man or woman even from another
artist’s work.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> ¶We can, however, only realize the work of genius
for which this portrait of Isabella stands when we compare it with the
picture with which the emperor had furnished him, that portrait by
‘a painter of small merit.’ The picture itself has, it is true, been
wholly lost, but a copy of it has recently come to light in Florence,
and is reproduced in these pages for the first time. That we are not
mistaken in assuming it to be a replica of the original from which
Titian worked will be proved by the complete coincidence of all the
principal characteristics of the picture in Madrid with the one before
us. In the Florentine picture the empress is wearing a black robe with
white puffed sleeves, a great deal of jewelry, and is holding a spray
of foliage in her hand. The picture is, for the most part, sombre in
tone, and the face stands out most effectively in its pallor. It has
that diaphanous whiteness noticeable in anæmic people. The dull reddish
hair frames it heavily. The background is a grey green; in a niche,
over which a dull red curtain is draped, the symbol of the exalted
rank of the sitter, the imperial crown, is represented. To judge from
its style this picture dates back to a Flemish master, though, with
the somewhat scanty inherent evidence available, it is impossible to
suggest the name of any particular artist. ¶ The picture originates
from Bologna, where it was in the possession of the Pepoli family. That
in itself is interesting, for we know that Isabella’s sister, Beatrice,
duchess of Savoy, had taken up her quarters in the Pepoli palace during
the rejoicings in 1530 in celebration of Charles V’s coronation, and
that it was the scene of a brilliant ball which the emperor honoured
with his presence. It would be well within the bounds of possibility,
therefore, that the portrait of the empress, who had been prevented
(she had been confined a short time previously) from coming to Bologna,
had passed into possession of the Pepoli as a present at first hand,
either from the emperor or from the duchess. A replica, with a few
trivial distinctions, of the picture is entered in the inventory of
the house of Farnese (about 1680). In this the left hand is resting on
the back of the chair.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The Florentine picture has undoubtedly
a conspicuous iconographic importance as the most authentic portrait
of the woman who shared the throne of Charles V. At the same time,
its value from the standpoint of the history of art is immeasurably
greater, inasmuch as it affords us a most interesting insight into Titian’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
methods. This picture should be compared with the painting in Madrid,
their points of variance carefully considered with the question why
the master omitted this or added that. It is as though in this picture
we were watching him at work with our very eyes. Especially noteworthy
is the fact that the imperial crown is not repeated. An artist
whose work lacks character needs a symbol as an outward and visible
sign-post. One, on the contrary, who knows how to express dignity
in the bearing of his sitter, can dispense with these commonplaces.
Titian was, of course, compelled to adopt the outline of the features,
the colouring of the complexion and of the hair. He even adopted the
pose in its main outlines. On the other hand he changed the colour
of the dress and the pose of the hands; the pose of the Florentine
picture is conventional and meaningless. By adding the book of hours
he gains a signal detail of characterization, for the empress was very
devout. If in the Flemish picture there is a certain note of contrast
brought out by the sombre dress and the costly jewels, in Titian’s
picture these ornaments blend with the costly draperies, glowing in
the richest colours which robe the empress here. More important still
is the fact that the antithesis is toned down thereby, and something
of life comes into the pale face by reason of the warm red robe,
while in the other it has a cold and lifeless tone, intensified by
the dead black garment. And here the little glimpse of landscape
which Titian introduces in the right-hand half of the picture gains
a special significance of its own. It deflects the eye a little,
well-nigh without arousing one’s consciousness that it is so doing;
it adds a nuance of restfulness and colour that has as subtle and
pleasing an effect as that of a Gobelin, although the landscape is
convincingly realistic, instinct with that realism that comprises in
its quintessence all the elements of colour and of form, and yet is
the abstraction of the characteristics of a definite locality. This,
comparatively speaking, small patch (considered as a patch of colour
within the picture as a whole) prevents the figure from standing out
in too hard relief from the dim-lit background and adds that very
essential element of atmosphere to give life to the picture. ¶ It is
worth noting that not until a, comparatively speaking, later period did
Titian make use of a landscape background. All his earlier portraits
show a neutral tone for the background. One finds it for the first
time, in so far as the number of Titian’s paintings known to us at
present justifies an expression of opinion, in the portrait of the
duchess of Urbino of 1537. Thenceforward Titian made very frequent use
of this subtle and life-giving device of his art. The portrait of Count
Porcia in the Brera gallery in Milan, the little Strozzi in Berlin, the
picture of Charles V in Munich are examples of it. Here the element
which henceforward is inseparable from courtly portraiture is created.
Rubens and Vandyke, above all, follow in the footsteps of the Venetian,
whose influence might be traced down to modern times. ¶ Put the Flemish
portrait by the side of Titian’s; it is, we see, the self-same picture
in its main outlines, and yet with what fundamental distinctions. On
the one hand the work of a ‘trifling brush’ (the emperor’s own words,
according to Aretino) and on the other the conscious feat of a prince
of painters. ¶ Nothing within the scope of artistic consideration can
afford so much incitement and pleasure as to force one’s way into the
work of the really great. For what they did is not merely a delight to
the beholder; it remains an enduring exemplar for the worker. From this
sole instance it becomes manifest how a thing insignificant in itself
may suffice to force the fruits of genius. Thus an Italian novel gives
birth to one of Shakespeare’s dramas, thus the puppet play of Doctor
Faust to Goethe’s sublimest work.</p>

DISCOVERED PORTRAIT DRAWING BY DÜRER</h2>

British museum, thanks to a timely hint from a friend, has recently
acquired a portrait drawing of considerable interest and unknown to
students of the present generation. It represents a middle-aged woman,
plain-featured and of a short, thick-set figure, seated, with clasped
hands, drawn in three-quarter face and looking to the left. The sitter
is plainly dressed, without a trace of ornament on the materials of
her clothing; she wears a ring on the first finger of her left hand,
and the artist has sketched very slightly a double or triple chain
with pendants hanging from her neck and reaching across her bodice
nearly to the waist. ¶ The portrait, which measures 16½ by 12⅜ ins.
(42 by 31·5 centimetres), is lightly drawn in black chalk on a green
prepared ground. The watermark of the paper is the large high crown
surmounted by a cross (Hausmann, No. 4). A border line, which can be
traced round three sides of the drawing, near the edge, is clearly a
modern addition, being drawn with lead pencil. The portrait itself
has entirely escaped retouching, and the whole sheet is in good
preservation, except in a few places where the surface has been rubbed
or stained; a severe crease across the lower right-hand corner of the
paper has caused the prepared surface to crack. ¶ In the left-hand
lower corner is the collector’s mark of Sir Thomas Lawrence, Fagan,
507 (1), stamped blind, and in the corresponding corner to the right
is the initial C, also stamped blind, which belonged, according to
Fagan (No. 72), to Captain William Coningham. The Lawrence stamp, in
this form, was affixed to the drawings by Samuel Woodburn after he had
purchased them in 1835. Coningham, too, had dealings with Woodburn;
it may be conjectured that he purchased the present drawing from
that dealer, and that it was included in the collection of drawings
by old masters which Coningham sold to Messrs. Colnaghi in 1846. That
would account for the absence of any mention of this drawing in the
catalogue of the Woodburn sale in June 1860, when the bulk of the
Lawrence drawings were finally dispersed. The drawing had been for a
long period in private hands prior to its purchase by the trustees of
the British museum in July of the present year, and had not appeared
in the sale-room. ¶ After so much has been said about externals, it
is time to look more closely at the drawing itself, which can only be
reproduced, at present, on a greatly reduced scale, though it is hoped
that an opportunity may present itself later on of issuing a full-sized
reproduction in facsimile.</p>

<p>I have said nothing, so far, about the
authorship of the drawing. The name of Holbein had been mentioned,
but from the moment in which I first set eyes on it I had scarcely a
doubt that the draughtsman was Dürer. No other artist of that date,
so far as I remember, drew portraits in chalk on a green ground. No
suspicion of forgery or fraud could be seriously entertained, and any
momentary hesitation suggested by the formation of the eyes, the weak
drawing of the left hand (an undeniable blemish), or the lack of energy
in the shading of the costume, was soon dispelled by comparison with
other drawings by Dürer on a similar scale and also on green paper,
the authenticity of which has never been questioned. The impression
suggested by the technique of the drawing itself was confirmed by an
examination of the inscription and date, which are written in indian
ink, and are indisputably genuine. Every letter is characteristic of
Dürer’s handwriting; the inscription may be compared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
especially with the long note of the same date on a drawing in the
Vienna Hofmuseum (Lippmann, 423), in which Dürer has recorded a
curious dream that he had in the early summer of 1525. The figures of
the date agree closely with those on the Vienna drawing, and still
more strikingly with those on a drawing in Mr. Heseltine’s collection
(Lippmann, 172), the portrait of a young lady in a hat, with a dog
on her lap, not signed, but dated 1525, also in indian ink. Mr.
Heseltine’s portrait is that of a much more attractive person; it is
also more carefully finished than the drawing which has recently come
to light: but the two have much in common, even to the weak drawing
of the left hand and the curious break in the outline of the upper
eyelid of the left eye. The pose of the two figures is the same; the
treatment of the clothes, both in outline and in shading, is curiously
similar. The new portrait may also be compared with two large drawings
on green paper already in the British museum: the portrait of Dürer’s
wife, seriously damaged, of 1522 (Lippmann, 291), and the much more
finished and masterly likeness of Henry Parker, Lord Morley (Lippmann,
87), drawn on the occasion of his visit to Nuremberg in 1523<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> as a
special envoy sent to confer the order of the Garter on the Archduke
Ferdinand. The ground of the latter drawing is of a bluer tint, but the
green of Mr. Heseltine’s drawing and of the portrait of Agnes Dürer is
almost identical with that of the new drawing in the British museum. ¶
The next question which arose when the authorship of the drawing was
established to my own, and, I may add, to Mr. Colvin’s satisfaction,
was the interpretation of the line of Dürer’s handwriting, ‘1525
Casmirs schwest<sup class="schwester">r</sup> fraw margret.’ No Casimir was known to me among the
circle of Dürer’s friends or patrons, but I was not long in finding a
solution which seems to meet all the requirements of the case. The name
Casimir at once suggested the royal house of Poland; a reference to
the first work on Polish history that lay at hand provided me with the
name of a connexion of that family whose residence was not far away
from Nuremberg. This was Casimir, margrave of Culmbach (1481–1527),
eldest son of the Margrave Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach and
Bayreuth (1460–1536) by his marriage with Sophia, daughter of Casimir
III of Poland. Frederick, being of feeble intellect, was deposed in
1515 by his sons and confined in the castle of Plassenburg; Casimir
thereupon ruled over the greater part of the Franconian possessions
of the house of Hohenzollern. He was a soldier with mediaeval ideas,
and a steadfast Catholic, in opposition to his brother George of
Bayreuth, who favoured the reformers; he died on September 21, 1527,
at Ofen, while holding a high command under Ferdinand in the Hungarian
war, and was buried, like most of his family, in the abbey church at
Heilsbronn. The name of his eldest sister was Margaret; she was born
in January 1483, and died, unmarried, in 1532. I suggest, then, that
this prince and princess, both living in 1525, are the Casimir and
Margaret of Dürer’s note. The portrait may well be that of a woman of
forty-two, though we might guess her to be older. There is nothing
unusual in the title ‘Frau Margret’ being applied to a lady of princely
rank; we may compare the titles ‘the Lady Mary,’ ‘the Lady Elizabeth,’
by which the princesses of our own royal house of Tudor were known
at the same period. I can discover no other portrait of Margaret of
Brandenburg-Ansbach, except as one of a group of the daughters of the
Margravine Sophia on a wing of an altarpiece at Heilsbronn<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>; here,
however, the kneeling princesses are all painted to one pattern, and
at so early an age that no comparison of the features is possible.
Dürer’s note is thus the only ground for believing that the newly
acquired portrait is that of a Hohenzollern princess.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span> ¶ I was not
previously aware that Dürer had enjoyed the patronage of any member of
that illustrious family, but I ascertained in the course of the present
investigation that there is reason to think that he had had direct
relations with the Margrave Casimir himself. Dr. Julius Meyer<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
describes a lost votive picture by Dürer, which represented the body of
our Saviour being anointed for burial, with Susanna, wife of Casimir,
kneeling in adoration, and Casimir himself standing at her right hand.
The picture is only known by a full description in a MS. inventory
written in 1768 by its then owner, Hofrath Christian Friedrich von
Knebel (1728–1805), at Ansbach. It was signed and dated 1518 in gold.
It was painted, therefore, in the year of Casimir’s marriage with
Susanna (1502–1543), daughter of Duke Albert III of Bavaria by his
marriage with Kunigunda of Austria, sister of the Emperor Maximilian I.
Susanna is described by Knebel as ‘Dürer’s great protectress’; it is
reasonable to suppose, at any rate, that the close relations in which
he stood at this time with the emperor, her uncle, may have led to his
appointment to paint the portrait of the niece. ¶ I cannot resist the
conjecture—it is hardly more—that the portrait in Mr. Heseltine’s
collection was done at the same time, and represents another member of
the Margrave Casimir’s family, in all probability his wife, Susanna of
Bavaria. The lady cannot be another of his sisters, the youngest of
whom, Barbara, was at this time thirty, while the only other survivors,
Sophia and Anna, were forty and thirty-eight respectively, and already
married.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Susanna, on the other hand, was twenty-three, and the
portrait may well stand for a lady of that age. She appears to have
been fond of dogs, for a large dog lay before her in Knebel’s picture.
Medals of the years 1522, 1525 and 1527 respectively, containing
portraits of this princess, are reproduced in ‘Schaumünzen des Hauses
Hohenzollern,’ Berlin, 1901 (Nos. 522–524). No. 524, in which she is
represented in a wide hat, in three-quarter face to the right, agrees
best with Dürer’s drawing, but the features are far less pleasing,
and Dürer was not wont to flatter his sitters. In 1528, a year after
Casimir’s death, his widow married Otto Heinrich, of Neuburg, count
(afterwards elector) palatine. Two medals of the year 1529, by Peter
Flötner and Hans Daucher, representing Susanna in profile, are
preserved in the Munich and Vienna cabinets respectively.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Both are
superior as works of art to the earlier portraits reproduced among
the Hohenzollern medals, and they tend, I think, to confirm, if not
to prove, my hypothesis. ¶ Mr. Heseltine’s drawing formerly had an
inscription which doubtless gave the name of the person represented.
Unfortunately some vandal has cut the paper down, and his scissors have
only left the extreme ends of two letters, which may be seen above the
date, 1525, written, exactly as on the British museum drawing, with
indian ink. Dr. Lippmann, in his note on No. 172, suggests that the
lady was an Englishwoman and the drawing a counterpart to the portrait
of Morley. This entirely gratuitous assumption compels him to suppose
that the date was added by a later hand, and that the drawing was
really made a few years earlier than 1525. The authentic inscription
and date on the portrait of ‘Fraw Margret’ dispose, I think, of that
suggestion. ¶ The new portrait, though not one of the finest class of
Dürer drawings, is a welcome addition to the London collection, which
is already unusually rich in large portrait-heads of the master’s later
years.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hide-first2">T</span>HROUGHOUT
the history of art, or rather the history of collecting,
there has always been, in conjunction with the desire to collect, a
hesitancy in collecting just those things which are ever with us and
about which we know the most. Though tremendously characteristic of our
age, this hesitancy is by no means confined to it. The Japanese print
was ever despised in Japan, and still is, except from its pecuniary
point of view, by that grossly over-rated, so-called clever people,
who only learned to appreciate their own prints when taught to by
the despised western barbarian; the etching of Rembrandt, until the
dealer discovered its value, could mostly be obtained for a song; the
mezzotint, when it was published, filled the place of the photograph,
brought only a guinea, or so, though the near-as-possible counterfeit
now is announced to be sold as a rarity in limited editions at the
price of the original; the etching of Meryon, valued to-day as much
for the paper it is printed on as for what is printed on the paper,
was sold by the artist for a few francs, in several cases quite
its full value—all these things and endless more are the sport of
the collector. ¶ And yet it has always seemed to me extraordinary
that the collector, who prizes works of the graphic arts mainly for
their rarity, has never collected those which really are rare. It is
inconceivable, it is astonishing and unbelievable, that the art of the
nineteenth century, the art of illustration, has been so neglected
that the original drawings, though they have been always with us, have
never yet been properly prized, appreciated, catalogued and collected.
I know that old drawings are collected, but the collector’s interest
in them to a great extent dates only from yesterday, and even now their
price does not equal that of prints from them, of which there may be
dozens, or, in fact, nobody knows how many examples in existence.
But I also know that, within the last hundred years, drawings,
illustrations, have been made in England and America that will rank
with any, ever made anywhere, in any age, and that these works of art
are absolutely ignored. And they are ignored simply because they have
not been collected, because in this country the British museum cannot
purchase the work of living British artists, and often it is during
the lifetime of the artist only that they can be secured, because in
France there is no place to exhibit drawings save in a corner of the
Luxembourg; the rest the French government possesses are buried in the
Cabinet des estampes. Theoretically, the rule of the British museum
may be a good one; it may be thought a safeguard against as terrible a
hodge-podge as that presented on the walls of the art gallery at South
Kensington. To some of us, however, a remedy suggests itself—change or
modify the rule, and, under intelligent direction, there is no reason
why collections as fine as those in Dresden and Berlin should not be
easily obtained even in England. ¶ The consequence of this neglect,
both deliberate and enforced on the part of the British government,
has been that here dealers and collectors, connoisseurs and amateurs,
have avoided original drawings almost altogether. Artists alone have
cared for them, have collected them, and still own almost all that
are best worth having.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> But now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span> that the best examples have been
collected, or have become impossible to collect, I see signs vaguely
of an appreciation. I do not for a moment think this is due to any
artistic awakening or any sudden recognition of a genuine form of
art—the art, as I have always described it, and as it will be known
in the future, of the nineteenth century. The real cause is to be
found rather in the desire for some new thing. Personally, I care very
little what is bringing the change about; I am merely delighted to
know that it is coming,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> for I have been preaching the beauty of
this work for many years, though, I admit, in a wilderness of paint,
prints, pots and postage stamps. When it does come, the possessors of
these drawings will find that they own, not only things of beauty, but
wonderful examples of an individual form of expression which owes its
existence altogether to the last century. I do not mean to suggest
that illustration is a modern form of art; it is as old as the world.
I do not mean to say that, in their way, the works of the artists of
the Renaissance are not glorious; I do not mean to say that the works
of the eighteenth century are not superb, after their fashion; what
I do mean is, that not until the nineteenth century in England, with
Blake and with Bewick, did illustration become a separate, independent
and individual branch of the fine arts. The reasons are simple—the
appearance of artists who loved and respected their profession, and the
improvement and development of technical and mechanical processes. ¶
Blake wished to show his art in his own publications. There was nothing
new in this; Dürer had done it centuries before. But Blake confined
himself virtually to illustration; with Dürer, it was only one of
his many means of expression. Bewick may or may not have learned to
adapt the technique of steel engraving to wood from Papillon; that
is a detail for the historian. What he did do, and what Papillon did
not, was to impose the new method successfully on the world. Not only
did Bewick produce his series of nature books, the forerunners of the
present fad for that sort of thing, but he invented a school and a
scientific manner of work which conquered the world. ¶ I have traced
already the development of English book-illustration, showing how it
spread from England to France and to Germany, and how, as it progressed
through these countries, artists appeared to work for it—great artists
in illustration but in nothing else, Meissonier and Menzel. I have
elsewhere shown how, though these artists were ready to draw upon
the wood block, they had to send to England for engravers to engrave
their designs; I have shown how the pupils and the methods of Bewick
were spread all over Europe: but while this was happening the art was
languishing in England. Lithography and cheapness had commenced to
stifle it. Education and the personal benefactor, the curses of this
country, were sitting on it. The equivalent in that day to the county
council, I doubt not, had it by the throat. It is true that William
Harvey, Linnell, and a few others carried on, as best they could, the
traditions of Bewick. But through the mid-century, Turner and his steel
engravers struggled with the lithographers, Harding, Prout and Lewis,
only that all alike might be undermined by Knight’s penny something
or other, and that horror, as it then was, <i>The Illustrated London
News</i>, always catering for the people, and the people damn any form
of art.</p>

<p>But, with the appearance in Germany, in 1840, of Menzel’s
‘Geschichte Friedrichs des Grossen,’ and its appropriation in 1845, by
the ingenious Mr. Bohn—I wonder what he paid for the blocks—a new era
dawned in England. And just one word about this book. It contains
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
500 illustrations by Adolf Menzel, and, says the advertisement, ‘in
the execution of the cuts both French and British artists (engravers)
have been engaged.’ But it so happened that they were all discarded
by the artist for German engravers whom he himself trained. The 500
illustrations were drawn by Adolf Menzel on the wood, and his trials
and tribulations are well known to all who have studied the history of
illustration. Five hundred drawings in one book, all done on little
wood blocks. Why, even this is enough to ruin anybody in our day, when
it is an honour to be devoid of technical ability and physical capacity
for work. But then we live in a time when incompetence, laziness and
anæmic imbecility are, in this country indispensible credentials to
fame. ¶ This book of Menzel’s, which has never been surpassed as an
example of reproductive wood engraving, was seen by the Dalziels and
shown to, at any rate, Keene, Rossetti, Sir John Gilbert and, most
likely, Millais. If some of the lesser but more precious illustrators
then at work refused to look at it—well, the loss was their own, and
it is probably one of the reasons why so little afterwards was ever
heard of them. ¶ Some ten years later, in France, where ever since
the thirties the romanticists had been illustrating, notably Curmer’s
edition of ‘Paul et Virginie’ (1838), while Jean Gigoux in his ‘Gil
Blas’ (1836) had made an everlasting reputation, there appeared
Meissonier’s edition of the ‘Contes Rémois’ (1858), by which, and
not by his sensational dealings in paint with millionaires, his name
will be remembered. And then England woke up again. The first English
book which shows any evidence of a revival in art, an attempt to
escape from the be-Knighted, be-illustrated traditions, was William
Allinham’s ‘Music Master,’ which contains nine illustrations: seven
by Arthur Hughes, one by Rossetti—The Maids of Elfen Mere, which
appears really to have made a sensation—and one by Millais. It was
published in 1855. The English edition of Menzel’s ‘Fredrick’ came
out in 1845. ¶ It should not be forgotten that there had been a
strong saving remnant all along from the time of Bewick. Northcote’s
‘Fables’ appeared in 1828, ‘embellished’ by 280 drawings, ascribed by
Northcote, but really by Harvey, ‘most excellently drawn on the wood
and prepared for the engraver by Mr. William Harvey, and improved by
his skill’—even Northcote himself admitted this in one edition. The
‘Voyage of Columbus,’ undated and unsigned, illustrated by Stothard,
was possibly still earlier. Then there was the ‘Solace of Song’ (1837);
there was Lane’s memorable edition of the ‘Arabian Nights,’ illustrated
also by Harvey (1839); and there were certain other volumes; but one is
not now making a bibliography. However, it was with the ‘Music Master’
(1855) that the great change came. ¶ In 1857 Moxon issued his edition
of Tennyson, the only book which is well known. It is extraordionary
how little good work there is in it, but this little is of the utmost
importance, for it includes the monumental Rossettis and Holman Hunts,
and a few beautiful Millais. Even more extraordinary is the proof given
not long ago of the public’s indifference to great illustration, for
when, recently, just these few fine illustrations, together with the
poems to which they refer, were reprinted, accompanied not only by the
artists’ original studies for them, but by a most interesting essay
by Mr. Holman Hunt, one of the illustrators, this new edition fell
perfectly flat. This is not very creditable to the intelligence of the
British collector, but it is a fact.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> ¶ By 1859, the movement, with
the starting of <i>Once a Week</i>, got into full swing, and we are in
the golden age of illustration, the most striking, the most original
phase of British art. From this time onward, for ten years, the
publishers of this country issued a series of books and magazines that
have never been approached, and when the present tendencies in art are
considered, it is fairly safe to add will never again be approached
in England. Then, artists sought to put the best of themselves into
illustration on the wood block. Then, engravers endeavoured to engrave
these illustrations as well as they possibly could, and though all
of us have been forced regretfully to admit that the methods were
abominable, the drawing being cut all to pieces before it could be
printed, and the artist having no redress, the published results were
often astonishingly good. Then the printer took a pride in doing his
work as well as he knew how. And though it might be, and often was,
bad, it was the best of which he was capable, and it was frequently
much better than what is done to-day. Then, the publisher regarded
himself as a shopkeeper, whose business was merely to put his name on
the books and to sell them, and he was content to do this and nothing
more. Sometimes he succeeded, sometimes he failed. Now, not only does
he sit at the receipt of custom, but he dominates the whole. He tells
you what the public wants according to his ideas, and the length of his
purse, and his travellers’ opinions. And as in nine cases out of ten,
despite these authorities, he is supremely ignorant of the work which
he farms out, and as cheapness and vulgarity are his only gods, and
as paper has come down and process has come in, it is not surprising
that English book-illustration should be just where it is to-day. There
are, of course, exceptions to this rule among the publishers. They are
few, indeed. But they know their position, and it would be discouraging
to the rest to name them. ¶ But, the collector may ask, what in all
this defence of book-illustration is there for me? As I have pointed
out, the illustrations, at any rate up to 1865, were all drawn on the
wood block, and were all cut to pieces in the engraving. There remain,
therefore, only a very few and rare originals that for some reason
or other were not engraved. There also remain in many cases studies
for these illustrations. For example, the British museum has been
lately showing an illustration, so-called, by Sir J. E. Millais, for
his ‘Parables,’ published first in <i>Good Words</i>, and then in a
separate volume by the Dalziels (1864). This is not the illustration
really, but a study for it. It may safely be assumed that no original
drawings for book-illustration prior to 1865 exist, unless they are
simply drawings made on the wood for a book and never engraved, when
they are not book-illustrations at all—that is, illustrations which
have been used in a book—or unless they are drawings of some sort
made for the steel-engraver or the lithographer, which were copied
or translated by the engraver. For example, Turner’s illustrations
to Rogers’ ‘Poems’ exist as most commonplace water-colours in the
cellars of the National gallery. Turner and Goodall between them made
a great work of art out of the ‘Datur Hora Quieti,’ but there is no
original of this at all save the trifling water-colour suggestion.
Some of the artists, however, were in the habit of making studies in
pen-and-ink, or wash, or pencil, on paper, of the exact size of the
future engraving, and containing all the details of the design, which
was afterwards redrawn on the wood block. Mr. Sandys did this in very
many cases, and in some he even made large versions of the drawings,
especially for the ‘Amor Mundi,’ which is owned by Lord Battersea.
In his case, too, one or two of his drawings, I know, never were
engraved. One which I owned, and which is now in the Adelaide museum,
Australia, The Spirit of the Storm, was unfinished, and a second, done
for <i>Good Words</i> or <i>Once a Week</i>, for years kicked round in
a drawer in the office of Swain, the engraver, until I found it, when
it was engraved and published in <i>The Hobby Horse</i>; the reason for
this long neglect being that it had been considered too strong by the
prurient-minded publisher of that time.</p>

<p>After about 1865, or rather
before, for the books were published in that year, some of the drawings for the illustrated
editions of Dalziel’s ‘Arabian Nights, 1865,’ and ‘Goldsmith, 1865,’
were regarded by the engravers as so remarkable that they had
photographs made from these drawings on the wood, and then, by the
newly-discovered art of photographing on to wood, the photographs
were transferred on to other wood blocks, and the originals on the
wood preserved. Several are to be seen in the art gallery at South
Kensington. The British museum possesses a few, and so do the Adelaide
and Melbourne museums in Australia. Mr. Harold Hartley, Mr. Fairfax
Murray, Mrs. C. E. Davis, Boyd Houghton’s sister, and, I believe, Mr.
Heseltine, are among other owners of these rare drawings, either on
wood or paper. But the number is really very small. ¶ There is also
a series of drawings for Dalziel’s ‘Bible Gallery,’ commissioned by
the Dalziels as early as 1863, as far as I can gather from Messrs.
Dalziel’s own records, which are not too satisfactory. Most of the
drawings in this series, however, were made on paper, though some by
Mr. Watts and Sir Edward Poynter were on the wood, and uncut, and may
be seen at South Kensington. Messrs. Dalziel, finding what a marvellous
collection of illustrations they had obtained, wisely did nothing but
commission artists to make more, and the work was not brought out until
1880, when the drawings were all photographed on to the wood before
engraving, and thus preserved. Where most of them are to-day I do not
know. As separate illustrations and great works of art, I was the first
to call attention to them as far back as 1889. Those by Lord Leighton
are now regarded as his masterpieces, and there are very fine examples
of Ford Madox Brown, and Watts, and Sir Edward Poynter, who has never
done better work. From all but the artistic standpoint the book was a
failure. ¶ These, then, with rare unengraved examples which are bound
to turn up, constitute all the original drawings for book-illustration
reproduced by wood engraving which will ever be found, and they are
mostly owned by museums. I must point out, however, that forgeries,
both in the way of shameless copies of the originals, or prints
worked over with pen-and-ink, and wash, and even colour—the artists
themselves did this sometimes; Pinwell certainly did—and palpable
imitations, have all, within a short time, been submitted to me. But, I
should imagine, of all these finished drawings done upon the wood for
reproduction before 1865, there are not a hundred, probably not fifty,
that will ever come into the sale room. Of course, a great find may
some day be made in a publisher’s office, or an artist’s portfolio. But
I doubt it.</p>

<p class="mtop2">N<span class="smaller">OTE ON THE</span> I<span class="smaller">LLUSTRATIONS</span>.—These are mostly included merely
to show the sort of drawings the artists made for the engraver and
lithographer, who either translated them on to the plate or stone or
had an intermediary to do this for them. The first, by Stothard, is
in sepia, and a design, I know not for what book, but evidently a
headpiece or initial which would have been cleaned up by the engraver.
The second, by Bartolozzi, a <i>cul de lampe</i> in washes of indian
ink, is very pretty, and the engraver probably would follow it exactly,
though he would lose some of the freedom. The others on the same page,
by Westall and Courbould, are very typical, and represent the British
style of illustration for novels and stories at the beginning of the
last century, and very perfectly they represent it, and that is the
best I can say for them. The Westall, in wash and pen (indian ink),
is slightly touched with colour on the woman’s dress, and may have
been engraved on metal and printed in two or more tints. The other is
in simple black-and-white. The landscapes are very characteristic;
the upper, of the stolid, solid, British water-colourist, who was
determined at all costs to be British, and usually forgot he was an
artist. And the other, by Barrett,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span> is typical of the later work
when Turner had made himself felt with the ‘Liber,’ or did Turner
steal from Barrett? Any way, Barrett is seen at his best in this very
charming sepia drawing, evidently for an illustration, while the
‘Liber’ drawings at the National gallery show Turner as an illustrator
at his worst and his best. The methods of the two artists are
absolutely identical; washes, little work with pen, and much scraping
and scratching with the knife. As for the engravings, one is from
Northcote’s ‘Fables,’ 1828, and shows the perfection of the minute work
of Harvey and Jackson. Yet there is the feeling, somehow, of a big
landscape in the print, and the engraving is extraordinary, putting
to shame much of the modern so-called bold, but really blundering and
ignorant, work on wood. The printing also is excellent in Northcote’s
volumes. They were printed by J. Johnson, and the excellent blacks
the printer of to-day would, even with all his improved appliances,
have difficulty in equalling. The printing is much better than that
in the French book, ‘Gil Blas,’ by Everat (Paulin, 1836), in which
the ink is dull and grey, but in every other way the Gigoux shows
the wide difference in aims there was between the leading English
and French artists of that day: Harvey, all refinement; Gigoux, all
force, directness and go. Both these engravers seem to have rendered
the originals well. What the artists thought is another story. The
Gigoux also proves that Daniel Vierge worked out rather than invented
his style. The next two illustrations are from Curmer’s ‘Paul et
Virginie,’ 1838, which is usually regarded, as Curmer wished it, a
‘monument typographic’ to the glory of the artists who illustrated
it, is admitted to be the most important French illustrated book of
the period, and to it all the better remembered Frenchmen of the
time contributed something. Among the artists are Isabey, Paul Huet,
Jacque, Johannot, Français, Meissonier, Steinhell; the engravers were
Poiret, Lavoignat, Best, Brévière, Frenchmen; Bentworth, the German;
but Orin Smith, Branston, Mary Ann Williams and her brothers, English,
did the greater part of the work: a magnificent, artistic union, more
practical in many ways than visits of kings and the patter of papers.
The book was printed, and extraordinarily well printed, by Everat. ¶
The appearance of Turner as an illustrator changed things much. The
‘Solace of Song,’ published by Seeley, 1837, illustrated by Harvey,
and engraved by W. T. Green and others, is simply metal engraving on
wood, and is astonishing as an example of what can be done. The final
outcome is seen in the print from ‘Sacred Allegories,’ by the Rev. W.
Adams (Rimingtons, 1856), one chapter of which, ‘The Distant Hills,’
is illustrated by Samuel Palmer and also engraved by Green. This
is, of its sort, probably the most perfect example of English book
illustration. ¶ But in Germany the greatest progress had been made
under Menzel, and his ‘Frederick,’ from which the print, The Round
Table, is taken, is simply magnificent. It was engraved by Krutchmar,
1840, and from it sprang modern illustration, as I have said, in
England. The first evidence is to be found in Rossetti’s Maids of Elfen
Mere in Allingham’s ‘Music Master,’ 1855. In 1858 came the ‘Contes
Rémois,’ Levy, illustrated by Meissonier, the perfection of French
work, and the beginning and end of his reputation, as well as the most
amazing proof of the genius of Lavoignat as a wood-engraver. After this
the art of illustration began to flourish in England, and in a year or
two the most superb work was being done.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hide-first2">A</span>LTHOUGH
the name of Andrea Vanni is by no means unfamiliar to the
student of Sienese painting, it is doubtful whether its mention
ever calls up to any but a few the image of a definite artistic
personality. What fame Andrea now has rests more upon tradition than
upon acquaintance with his art. He was born in 1333, or thereabouts.
An active participant in the popular uprising of 1368, which resulted
in the expulsion of the nobles and the foundation of the new
government of the <i>reformatori</i>, he played, during the twenty
years that followed, a busy and not unimportant part in the affairs
of the Sienese republic, leaving behind him a lengthy and honourable
record of the various offices which he held. In later years a friend
and warm admirer of his great townswoman Caterina Benincasa, he was
the recipient of much good counsel from that gentle saint, in the
shape of certain letters which have perhaps done more than all his
political achievements to keep alive the memory of his name. ¶ But it
is not with Andrea the diplomat, or Andrea the devotee, that we are
here concerned. Those who would know him better in these characters
need only examine the pages of Milanesi, of Banchi and Borghesi, and
of St. Catherine’s letters. Andrea has left behind him documents
of a very different nature, and of a far deeper interest, than any
of mere lettered parchment, and documents by no means so rare as
has generally been supposed. With all his diplomatic and official
celebrity, he was primarily an artist—perhaps not a great one in the
superlative usage of the word, but sufficiently interesting to warrant
an attempt to revive his memory as a painter by giving back to him a
number of works which, in his native town and elsewhere, pass to-day
under other, and sometimes greater, names. ¶ The works upon which
Vanni’s reputation as a painter has hitherto rested are only three
in number, and are all in his native town:—a well-known portrait
of St. Catherine, in the church of S. Domenico; a very little known
polyptych, in the church of S. Stefano; and a fragmentary Crucifixion,
once in the church of the Alborino, now in the Istituto delle Belle
Arti. Of these three works, whose common authorship is evident, the
altarpiece in S. Stefano and the Crucifixion in the Belle Arti are
given to Andrea on sufficiently reliable documentary grounds; the
likeness of St. Catherine, on the strength of a tradition of several
centuries. Despite its historical interest, and its great decorative
design, this portrait-fresco, in its present state, can help us to but
a slight idea of its author’s general style, and for this purpose the
unimportant and somewhat coarsely-painted fragment in the Belle Arti
can help us but little more. But the great polyptych of S. Stefano
is happily a very different and vastly more important work, and of
a nature to give us a satisfactory conception of Andrea’s manner at
the time in which it was executed. A glance at this huge painting, or
the accompanying reproduction, reveals at once that Vanni belonged to
that same group of late trecento painters of which Bartolo di Fredi
is the best known representative. Like the work of that master, it
shows the influence both of Simone Martini and of the Lorenzetti.
But it displays the qualities of a strongly-marked individuality as
well. ¶ Let us examine it in detail, commencing with the central and
most important panel of the Virgin and the Child. That which, apart
from the colour, strikes us immediately and most forcibly, is the
peculiar silhouette-like character of the design. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span> great figure
of the Madonna is thrown out like a dark, clear-cut pattern against
the golden background of her throne. Except for the face and hands,
there is little, if any, attempt at modelling or chiaroscuro. The whole
effect is flat to a degree, reminding us somewhat of the coloured
prints of Japan, with their sharply-defined outlines and broad fields
of colour. In this feeling for flat design, Andrea gives witness to
his being a follower—if an extreme one—of Simone’s methods. But he
has little or none of Simone’s subtle contours and undulating flow of
line. The drapery of Andrea’s Virgin is severely simple—there is a
remarkable economy of line and fold, reminding us in this rather of
Ambrogio Lorenzetti than of Simone. Her stiff, upright pose, again,
has none of the tender grace of Simone’s Madonnas and saints, and is
more akin to that of Ambrogio’s statelier figures. In facial type
Andrea’s Virgin is, however, distinctly his own. The large rounded
cranium, the narrow eyes and small half-covered iris, the delicately
drawn mouth, the firm but not obtrusive chin, go to make up a set
of features not easily forgotten. The Christ-Child, again, reveals
decidedly the influence of Simone’s models, and finds its prototype
in the Child of Simone’s great fresco of the Majestas in the Palazzo
della Signoria, as well as in other works by him, by his close follower
Lippo Memmi, and by their school. ¶ Turning now to the other figures,
we note in the Baptist a striking similarity, even in the smallest
details, to Simone’s figures of that saint at Pisa and at Altenburg,
of which it is evidently a free copy. The St. Bartholomew shows like
influences in a less degree. The figures of SS. James and Stephen are
more Vanni’s own—the head of the latter being a free repetition of
the Virgin’s. The Annunciation is severely vigorous and individual,
the dark figure of the Virgin again showing, very clearly, Andrea’s
love of the silhouette. The side figures of saints, and the evangelists
in the pinnacles, reveal a slightly stronger sense of modelling and
characterization, and remind us of Bartolo di Fredi and Luca di Tommé.
The colour throughout is bright and clear, laid out in broad and simple
masses, with a parsimonious use of shading and a lavish use of gold.
¶ If Tizio’s notices of this altarpiece be correct—and there is no
reason to doubt that they are so, especially as the style of the work
itself supports rather than contradicts them—it was painted in or
about 1400. It is, therefore, the production of a man already verging
on his seventieth year, and must represent the later, if not the
last, development of Vanni’s style. As we have already noted, it has
a family likeness to the work of Bartolo di Fredi and others of his
school. Still, despite all superficial or general resemblances, these
two painters are widely different in style and spirit. In pure grace
and charm, Bartolo leaves Vanni far behind him. Andrea’s work again,
at least as we here see it, has none of the softly-graded colour, the
delicate modelling, the freer line, the careful technical finish of
detail—none of the <i>bibelot</i> quality in fact—of Bartolo’s at
its best. But, for all that, it convinces us that his was the deeper,
grander soul. For mere prettiness or elaborate technical refinement
he displays little sympathy or care. Directness and simplicity of
expression, staid dignity and great seriousness of purpose—these seem
the salient characteristics of his nature, as we read it in his art;
nor do they disagree with the conception which the written records
convey to us of the man.</p>

  VANNI IN S. FRANCESCO, SIENA</div>
</div>

<p>Taking this altarpiece, then, as a fairly
characteristic example of Vanni’s mature style, I shall bring before
the reader’s notice a series of works, at present under other names,
one and all of which share with it, in a greater or a less degree, all
the peculiarities which I have already pointed out, as well as others
to which I have not yet drawn attention. Not the least among these
works, in size and in importance, is a picture of the Enthroned Virgin
and Child, popularly known as the Madonna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span> degli Infermi, in the church of S. Francesco at Siena. Those who
have once seen this strangely impressive painting will not be likely
to forget it. The colossal Virgin is seated upright on her throne,
majestic and solemnly hieratic, the grave-visaged Child supported
on her arm. There is something enigmatic, mysterious, superhuman,
in the commanding grandeur of the figures, which the photographic
reproduction<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> can but partially convey. They remind us of some of
the works of early Byzantine art, in their strange impassiveness and
impersonality, far rather than of those of late fourteenth-century
Siena. The panel has been cut down, and evidently once formed but
part of an even more imposing whole. The flesh parts have darkened
as if by smoke, and now have the colour of mahogany; the glazings
and the surface coatings have entirely disappeared. The picture is
traditionally attributed to Pietro Lorenzetti, but there can be no
question as to its real author. Let us compare it with the central
panel of the S. Stefano polyptych. Even in its present damaged state,
the analogies which it offers to that painting are so apparent that
it is more than surprising some passing critic, or even some local
art-historian, has not long ago given it back to its true painter,
striking and important picture as it is. The similarities between the
two Madonnas seem hardly to require comment. The same clearly-outlined
figure, the same sedate pose, the same dark mantle with its golden
border and broad and simple folds, the same head, eyes, nose, and
mouth, the same hands—to dwell longer on these points would be
merely to waste words. Here we have, beyond a doubt, another work of
Andrea Vanni, belonging to the same period as, and sharing all the
characteristics of, the S. Stefano polyptych—only in a severer and
grander vein. As if in support of our conclusions, Tizio tells us
that at about the same time Andrea painted his great picture for S.
Stefano he executed still another similar work for the friars minor
of S. Francesco. Doubtless this present panel once formed part of
the work to which he refers, nor would it be stretching a point too
far to say that its present half-ruined condition is probably due to
damage suffered during the disastrous conflagration which, in 1655,
wrecked the great building wherein it stood and destroyed so many of
its treasures. ¶ But this, to my mind, is not the only work by Vanni
still to be seen in this same restored church of S. Francesco. In the
last chapel of the north transept is an imposing fresco of the Virgin
seated with the Child in an elaborate architectural throne. It is
generally attributed to Ambrogio Lorenzetti, and has been published
with his name. As it now stands, this fresco has been almost entirely
renewed, but enough of its original spirit still remains to afford the
practised eye some slight idea of its primitive state. The incised
outlines are still virtually unchanged, and the forms of the figure and
the broad folds of the drapery have preserved, to a great extent, their
original character. As is usually the case, the faces have undergone
the greatest transformation, yet even here the original features have
not been entirely lost. Quite enough remains, in fact, to convince
me that in this case also we are in the presence of what was once an
important work of Andrea Vanni. The entire figure of the Virgin, the
peculiarly marked outline, the dignified position, the oval head, the
narrow eyes, and the straight nose, the characteristic and tell-tale
folds of the voluminous mantle, their peculiar arrangement about the
feet, the long wrist and hand, still pierce through the modern covering
of repaint, clearly revealing the touch of Vanni’s brush. ¶ In far
better condition, and far easier of identification, is the half-length
panel of the Virgin and Child—evidently once part of a larger work,
but now cut down to fit an oval frame—in the chapel of the SS. Chiodi
in Siena.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span> This picture, usually given to Barna, was surmised, but only
surmised, by Crowe and Cavalcaselle, to be a possible work of Vanni.
The reasons for their hesitation are rather difficult to find, and
they were certainly correct in their conjecture, for the work is as
evidently by Vanni as is the great Madonna of S. Francesco. But here
we have our painter in a very different, far gentler, almost playful,
strain. As usual, the Virgin is seated sedately upright on her throne,
clad in the conventional dark mantle, fastened, as in the fresco of
S. Francesco, by a splendid golden clasp. The head and face are the
same in shape and features as in the other panels; the expression
less serious and solemn. The Child is pleasing in type and action.
With one hand to His mouth, He presses with the other His Mother’s
bared breast as He looks half shyly towards the spectator. Here again
there is none of the hieratic solemnity of the S. Francesco panel. The
colour—apart from the repainted mantle—is warmer, and the modelling
of the flesh parts softer, than in the picture of S. Stefano, but the
forms and details are the same. ¶ Somewhat similar in spirit to this
last-named work are two other panels, one in the church of S. Spirito,
the other in S. Giovanni in Pantaneto, better known as S. Giovannino
della Staffa. The first of these is a full-length figure of the Virgin
holding in her arms the Christ-Child, who plays with a bird. At the
foot of the throne kneels a diminutive figure of the donor, cap in
hand. The Virgin sits in the upright position common to all the
pictures we have so far examined; she has the same bend of the head,
the same stereotyped set of features. The architecture and perspective
of the throne are the same as in the picture of the SS. Chiodi and
the fresco in S. Francesco. The Child is not unpleasing in action and
expression. The figure of the Virgin has suffered considerably from
repaint, the mantle being in great part quite new. The original colour
is bright and gay, but the execution is less careful than in most
of Vanni’s works, and would lead us to place this panel in the last
years of his activity, when his brush had lost some of the freshness
of its touch, were it not for the energetically, and at the same time
carefully, executed little figure of the kneeling donor, damaged and
darkened but still intact—a remarkable piece of early portraiture,
finely characterized. Judging from the shape of this panel, it also
once formed part of a triptych or polyptych. The Madonna of S. Giovanni
has suffered far more from restoration, the figure of the Christ-Child
being here almost entirely repainted. The still pleasing Virgin
displays Vanni’s usual type, and differs but slightly from the Madonna
in S. Spirito, although originally it may have been a more carefully
executed figure. Still another picture, a charming little Annunciation,
in the possession of Count Fabio Chigi at Siena, also clearly shows
Andrea’s hand: it is very careful in execution and graceful in
movement—far more free in this respect than the similar but severer
treatment of the subject in the polyptych at S. Stefano. The types are
Vanni’s usual ones, the colour is quiet and subdued.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> ¶ But finer
in quality and in a better state of preservation than any of these
works, is a little picture of the Virgin and Child belonging to Mr.
Bernhard Berenson, at Florence. That it is by Vanni needs no urging
on my part—a moment’s comparison of the accompanying reproduction
with any of the paintings which we have already examined is sufficient
to prove this very obvious fact. It would be hard to imagine a more
characteristic and at the same time a more charming example of his
work. Yet in some ways it differs considerably from the paintings we
have so far studied, especially in its more painstaking and finished
execution, and in its light golden tone of colour, so very unlike
that of such works as the Madonnas of S. Spirito and the SS. Chiodi.
Although not without the dignity which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
Vanni never fails to give her, the Virgin in Mr. Berenson’s picture
is less sedately grave than in the panels at S. Francesco and S.
Stefano—the Child less grown-up and solemn. Both, again, are in
Vanni’s softer, more gentle mood. Belonging to Mr. Berenson also, we
have another panel by Andrea, painted in a very different style and
spirit. It represents the Deposition from the Cross, and must have been
part of a predella to an altarpiece. Derived from Ambrogio Lorenzetti’s
treatment of this sublime theme, it yet is more restrained, more
intellectual, and more clearly arranged.

  PIETRO OVILE, SIENA</div>

</div>

<p>The famous portrait of St. Catherine which I have already mentioned, and which is too well
known to require description, and the Crucifixion in the Belle
Arti—a fragment of a larger work painted in 1396—would bring this
particular list of Vanni’s works to a temporary close,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> were it
not for still another painting, perhaps even more interesting than
any of these, which to my mind must also be classed with them. In the
church of S. Pietro Ovile, at Siena, we find a beautiful free copy
of Simone Martini’s famous Annunciation, now in the Uffizi gallery.
This picture has aroused the admiration of numberless tourists and
the curiosity of more than one writer on Siena’s art. Apart from its
traditional attribution to Simone and Lippo Memmi themselves, it has
undergone a series of widely different baptisms at a variety of hands;
from a trecento it has become a quattrocento painting, and so back
again. It has long been my conviction, as it has been that of no less
an authority on Sienese painting than Mr. Berenson before me, that
this picture is a work of Andrea Vanni. I am quite well aware of the
surprise which this sudden attribution will cause to many, as I am
also of the difficulties in proving my point with the limited and
unsatisfactory aid which photographs afford. In an article supported
only by photographic reproductions, that most important of all
arguments, quality, and, as in this case, the hardly less convincing
one of colour, must in great part be laid aside. Nevertheless, there
remains, in this particular instance, so much that can be demonstrated
by photographic evidence in support of Vanni’s claims, that I shall
make the attempt. ¶ Of the history of the Annunciation now in S.
Pietro, nothing appears to be known. As it now exists it stands no
longer above an altar, but is let into the wall of the church. In shape
and size it was evidently once quite similar to Simone’s original,
but it has since been cut down and shortened at the sides and bottom.
The three panels which now surmount it have nothing to do with the
picture itself, and are the work of two different painters of the
quattrocento—the Crucifixion is probably by Giovanni di Paolo; the
two figures of St. Peter and St. Paul by Matteo di Giovanni, as we
see him in the remains of the altarpiece at Borgo S. Sepolcro, which
once contained, as its central panel, Piero dei Francesci’s Baptism
of Christ, now in London. They were probably placed in their present
position at a relatively recent date. As to its condition, the picture
has evidently not always enjoyed the care that is now given it, for it
is considerably damaged and darkened. The hand of the restorer has not
been absent, alas! and there are, unfortunately, visible traces of his
brush in the heads and hands, and in the Virgin’s draperies. ¶ That
we have here a copy, and in some ways a fairly close one, of Simone’s
famous picture, is obvious; that it was painted directly from Simone’s
original, which was at that time in the cathedral of Siena, is no less
certain; that it was painted by an artist who was throughout seeking
to overcome the peculiarities of his own somewhat strongly marked
style, and that he was but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span> partially successful in so doing, is also
apparent. ¶ Let us examine the work more closely, and in its separate
parts, commencing with the figure of the Virgin. It shows but little
of the ease of movement and grace of line to be found in Simone’s
original. The high-waisted figure; the stiff, upright, almost rigid,
position; the line of the shoulders and the knees; the peculiar poise
of the head; the straight-falling folds of the drapery and the line of
the mantle as it catches the arm in its downward flow: all are points
which find their counterpart in the works of Vanni, and in those of no
other painter. Here, also, we have the same simple, strongly-marked
outlines, the same dark field of colour relieved, pattern-like and
comparatively flat, against the lighter background. Although the blue
of the Virgin’s mantle has darkened considerably, it is still apparent
that her figure was always fairly innocent of modelling—far more so
in fact than that of Simone’s Virgin. For Simone, with all his love of
outlined pattern, does not stop at this—his contour, however clear
and distinct, is far more flowing, far more subtle—his mass is far
less flat and unrelieved. Although the painter of the S. Pietro copy
has tried more or less faithfully to copy the arrangement of Simone’s
drapery, he has done it, perhaps despite himself, in his own way. The
folds in the copy have an entirely different character from that which
they possess in the original; they are precisely what we might imagine
Vanni doing in an attempt to be particularly graceful. But if all these
points in the drapery and figure remind us so unmistakably of Vanni’s
style, we discover in the Virgin’s head even closer affinities with
that master’s other works. The same well-rounded cranium and oval face;
the same narrow eyes, with the small half-covered iris and high-arched
brows; the same long straight nose (still clearly recognizable as
Vanni’s, despite scaling and later retouching); the identical mouth;
the same inclination of the head and its peculiar setting on the neck;
the same chin; the same long, slender hands: all are to be found in
one or other of the works we have already mentioned, and especially
in Mr. Berenson’s Madonna. Here we have, also, Vanni’s love of gold
brocade in the Virgin’s under garment and in the hangings of the
throne. The figure of the angel is no less characteristic. The drapery
is here incontestably Vannesque in its peculiar, not over-graceful,
folds. Here, again, is the clear outline, the slight modelling, and
the sparing use of chiaroscuro, the same treatment of the draperies,
the long hands and thin arms, as in all Vanni’s other works. The
outline of the face, chin, and neck has been damaged and gone over,
and the peculiar, straggling, dark-brown curls are a later addition,
and contrast strongly with the lighter golden hair behind them. Apart
from these slight changes, the head, although a would-be copy of
Simone‘s, shares Vanni’s characteristic features. The cherubs about
the Holy Spirit already point to the end of the trecento. The roman
lettering of the inscriptions we find used likewise on the scroll held
by the Christ-Child in Mr. Berenson’s picture. ¶ So much for material
resemblances, of which the reader may gather some idea by means of the
accompanying illustrations. And now a word as to the colour of the
work. Its striking resemblance, in this respect, to the Madonna of Mr.
Berenson’s collection, will not fail to carry conviction where there
may before have existed only persuasion. In the general quality of
technique, and more especially in the remarkable golden tone of colour
and the peculiar treatment of the flesh, the two works are strangely
alike, and cannot help but do away with any final doubts as to their
community of authorship.</p>

<p>In the preceding pages I have tried to
prove—the reader can best judge with what success—Vanni’s claims to
the authorship of a certain group of pictures, so closely related in
style, quality, and spirit, as clearly to belong to the same period of
his activity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
as that which produced the polyptych of S. Stefano. As we know, this
period was one of a comparatively old age. Yet it would seem as if
Andrea had turned, during the later years of his life, with a renewed
activity, to the practice of his art, after the busy public career of
his prime. Judging from the scarcity of documents of an official nature
connected with his name after 1384, it would seem that, somewhere about
that year, he retired from active participation in political affairs
and devoted himself wholly to his painting. That he was inactive as an
artist, however, during all his earlier years, is not to be believed.
We have, in fact, a line of documents to prove that this was not the
case. Still, these written records help us very little in the tracing
of his earlier artistic development. Evidently in origin a pupil of the
school of Lippo Memmi, I should place in the period of his ascendance a
somewhat hard and gaudy, but not uninteresting, triptych, representing
St. Michael between St. Anthony the abbot and the Baptist, No. 67
of the Siena gallery. This work, which is in a remarkable state of
preservation, is attributed to Lippo Memmi himself, and clearly shows
the characteristics of his school. There is much in the figures which
bears a close similarity to Andrea’s later types. Another panel—a
Virgin and Child in the priest’s house, next to S. Pietro Ovile—having
close affinity to Simone and Lippo Memmi in technical treatment, in
colour, and even in style, seems to presage in a far more definite
manner the works of Vanni which we now know, and already shares many
of his peculiar characteristics in detail. But, apart from these two
paintings, I can call to mind no works of these early years which I
can with any confidence give to him. The first notice of Andrea as a
painter is one of 1353, in which year he was associated with Bartolo
di Fredi, whether as partner or assistant is not quite clear. The last
records of his activity are dated 1400. Milanesi, upon some unnamed
authority, gives the probable date of his death as 1414. ¶ It would
prolong this article unduly if the questions of Vanni’s influence upon
Sienese art, and of his possible pupils and apparent successors, were
entered into with the fullness which the subject demands. We must limit
ourselves here to a brief mention of the closest of the followers of
Vanni in those later years in which chiefly we have been studying him,
a painter less known even than himself, Paolo di Giovanni Fei. An
apparently early work by him, the Madonna del Rosario of S. Domenico,
suggests that he was actually the pupil of Vanni. By him, also, are
three pictures in the Siena gallery, one in the chapel of S. Bernardino
just outside the Porta Camollia, another in the Saraceni collection,
and yet another in the Minutolo chapel of Naples cathedral.</p>

worked in Bruges from the commencement of 1484 until his
death, August 13, 1523, yet he does not appear to have taken a single
apprentice during all that period, at least the register of the gild
of St. Luke contains no entry of any such. It is, however, certain
that he had several assistants; one of these, Adrian Isenbrant, I was
able to rescue from oblivion in 1865. He came to Bruges in 1510, was
admitted as free master into the gild on November 29, and continued
working there for more than forty years, until his death in July
1551. He acquired a reputation for skill in painting the nude and
the human countenance, and executed many pictures for Spain, which
as a rule he sent by Antwerp to Bilbao. Although no document has as
yet been discovered connecting his name with any particular picture,
yet there is hardly any doubt that he is the author of a number of
works certainly painted in Bruges between 1510 and 1551, the figures
in which are remarkable for their careful execution and sweetness of
expression, characteristics attributed to the works of Isenbrant by
old writers. Several of these works are still in Spain, others have
been brought from the Peninsula within the last fifty years. Of these
I purpose to treat later on; at present I shall confine my remarks to
the works included in the exhibition. The most important of these is
a large diptych given to the church of Our Lady at Bruges by Barbara
Le Maire, widow of George Van de Velde, a wealthy cloth merchant, who
had held many offices in the communal council. The dexter panel (178)
represents the Blessed Virgin seated with clasped hands, overwhelmed
with grief, in a niche of Renascence architecture. Around her, set
in architectural framework, are seven little pictures representing
the seven dolours; in some of these are motives borrowed from the
engravings of Martin Schongauer and Albert Dürer. The sinister panel
(179), which disappeared from the church about 1832, came into the
possession of the duke of Arenberg, who in 1874 sold it to the Brussels
museum. On the face are pictured George Van de Velde in the costume
of a brother of the confraternity of the holy Blood, and his wife,
protected by their baptismal patrons, and accompanied by their nine
sons and eight daughters, all kneeling in prayer. The subject on the
dexter panel is repeated on the reverse of this in grisaille but with
differences, so that whether the diptych was shut or open, on festivals
or ferias, the figure of the sorrowful Mother, to whom the widow Van
de Velde was very devoted—<i>multum affectata</i>—was always exposed
to the veneration of the faithful. George Van de Velde died on April
28, 1528; his second son, John, who in the picture wears a surplice,
was ordained priest and said his first mass in the church of Our Lady
in 1530—31, about which date his mother presented the picture. ¶ The
Blessed Virgin and Child seated in a landscape with SS. Katherine,
Barbara, Dorothy, Margaret and Agnes (145), lent by Count Arco-Valley,
is a charming early composition, of which there is a weak repetition
in the academy of St. Luke at Rome. The prototype of this picture is
doubtless the dexter panel of the diptych painted by Memlinc for John
Du Celier, now in the Louvre at Paris, whilst variations are in the
gallery at Munich, at Geneva, and at Buckingham Palace. A triptych lent
by M. Lotman, of Berne (177), represents the Blessed Virgin and Child
and two angels playing a mandoline
and a harp; and on the exterior, St. Jerome praying before a crucifix.
The carpet here is from the same model as that under the Virgin’s feet
in 145.</p>

<p>A panel (183) belonging to the earl of Northbrook represents
the Blessed Virgin and Child enthroned, in a garden, beneath a canopy,
to which is attached a cloth of honour; the donor and his wife and
family kneel at the sides; the background is formed by a stone wall,
on which two peacocks and a pea-hen are sunning themselves. The head
of our Lady has been restored. ¶ Two shutters of a triptych (180),
lent by Mr. R. von Kaufmann, represent a donor and his wife with their
children protected by St. John the Evangelist and St. Barbara(?). The
donors on these shutters are, though a few years older, strikingly like
those in 183. But in the earlier picture the man, aged thirty-four, is
represented with one son and one daughter, both dead when the picture
was painted, while behind his wife, aged thirty-three, kneel a boy
of nine and a girl of five. The man in 180 is represented with one
son dead, and his wife with three daughters, one of whom was dead.
¶ The vision of St. Ildephonsus, bishop of Toledo (151), belonging
to Lord Northbrook, is in every respect a very remarkable work; the
composition unusually good, the colouring rich and harmonious. The
saint, kneeling on the foot-pace of an altar on the north side of a
large church of picturesque architecture, looks up with outstretched
arms at the Blessed Virgin, who, attended by three lovely angels, is
about to vest him with a chasuble. Behind him kneel three monks, two
looking up at the heavenly apparition, the third absorbed in prayer.
In the background a procession of chanting monks, followed by a pious
crowd of lay folk, winds its way round the choir. The figures of all
are most carefully executed, and are remarkable for the delicacy of
their modelling and sweetness of expression.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> ¶ Another brightly
coloured picture (152), also belonging to Lord Northbrook, represents
the Blessed Virgin seated on a stone throne adorned with rams’ heads,
holding the divine Child, who has his left arm round her neck and
is caressing her chin. The Virgin’s face has little character, but
the Child’s expression is very pleasing. ¶ St. Mary Magdalene in the
desert, kneeling before a large crucifix held by an angel (182), from
the De Somzée collection, is a remarkable work, with a landscape
background with peculiar rocks. A panel with a half-length figure of
St. Luke holding a portrait of the Blessed Virgin and Child (187),
lent by Messrs. P. and D. Colnaghi, is a fine work, the evangelist
being probably the master’s own portrait. A triptych belonging to the
cathedral of Bruges (184) represents in the centre the Presentation
in the Temple with the kneeling figure of an Augustinian nun of the
Le Gros family, probably the granddaughter of Philip Wielant and
Joan van Halewyn, whose portraits on the shutters, as remarked by M.
G. Hulin, are evidently not painted from life. The triptych, which
probably came from one of the Augustinian convents suppressed at the
end of the eighteenth century, was, with many others now preserved in
the cathedral, presented to it by M. van Huerne. ¶ A panel (185) lent
by M. Sedelmeyer, with full-length figures of St. Andrew, St. Michael,
and St. Francis in the foreground, with a representation of Calvary in
the upper portion, is a late work, the Calvary closely resembling that
in the diptych of our Lady of seven dolours. The exhibition included
several other works either copies or painted under the influence of
Isenbrant. ¶ Two other masters who flourished in Bruges about this
time, and who were restored to history by me, one in 1860 and the other
in 1863, were each represented by one authentic work. John Prevost, a
native of Mons in Hainault, was born c. 1462. It is not known where
he learned his art or to whom he was apprenticed. He visited Antwerp
in 1493 and was admitted as free-master into the gild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span> of St. Luke,
but shortly after removed to Bruges, where he bought the right of
citizenship and settled definitely. He also purchased the freedom of
the town of Valenciennes in 1498, in which year, if not previously,
he married Joan de Quaroube, a well-to-do elderly lady, who, after
twenty-five years of wedded life, had in 1489 been left a widow by
the celebrated painter and miniaturist Simon Marmion. She died in
1506. Prevost, who married again three times, died in January 1529.
The only picture proved by documentary evidence to be by him is the
Last Judgement (167), painted in 1525 for the town hall, lent by the
museum where it is now kept. An earlier representation of the same
subject, said to have been painted by him for the Dominicans of Bruges
(169), was lent by Viscount de Ruffo Bonneval. A third, lent by Mr.
E. F. Weber (168), attributed to him by M. Hulin,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> appears to me
to be the work of an imitator. It is not only inferior in drawing and
execution, but the treatment of the subject—the risen are bringing
account books which the angels are verifying—is childish. M. Hulin
enumerates eleven other pictures as being certainly, and three more as
possibly, by Prevost. Four of these were in the exhibition (109, 157,
189, and 342); a fifth, the Blessed Virgin and Child in an aureole
surrounded by angels, with the prophets and sibyls, at St. Petersburg,
which he believes to be the picture painted in 1524 for the altar of
St. Daniel in the church of St. Donatian at Bruges. The other six
are SS. Antony of Padua and Bonaventure, in the Brussels gallery; an
Adoration of the Magi, at Berlin; the Blessed Virgin and Child, in the
National gallery (No. 713, attributed to Mostaert); another with SS.
Benedict and Bernard, at Windsor castle; another with a carthusian,
exhibited as by Isenbrant at the Burlington club in 1892; and a
Virgin and Child, at Carlsruhe, where it is attributed to Gossart.
The three which he thinks may be attributed to him are the heads of
Christ and the Blessed Virgin (193 and 194), and the charming picture
of St. Francis renouncing the world (150), belonging to Mr. Sutton
Nelthorpe. Few indeed are those who write on the early masters who can
resist the temptation of attributing to them a goodly list of works.
Much may be learnt when, as in the present case, serious arguments are
started which can be discussed, and no harm can result so long as the
attributions are not accepted as certainties by museum authorities.
¶ The other master, Albert Cornelis, who died in 1532, is still only
known by one remarkable picture (170), the Coronation of the B. Virgin.
¶ A painting of the Mater dolorosa (105), formerly in the church of
the Austin friars, lent by the cathedral, is said to be a copy of a
miraculous picture in the church of Ara caeli at Rome, of which other
copies were formerly at Abbenbroek and Romerswale in Zealand, and a
third, if not one of these two, is now in the gallery at Munich. The
copy exhibited was traditionally attributed to John van Eyck, and the
cipher in the corner, supposed to be his, was adduced as a proof.
This cipher, retouched by the restorer who re-gilt the background, is
certainly that used as a signature by John van Eecke or van Eeckele,
a painter who settled in Bruges and was admitted as free-master into
the gild of St. Luke in September 1534, and worked there until his
death in November 1561. A panel lent by the museum of Tournay (106),
representing the vision of St. Bernard with other episodes in the life
of that saint in the landscape background, is an original work of
the master signed with his cipher. ¶ A panel (250) lent by the Black
Sisters represents St. Nicolas of Tolentino, and on the exterior an
Austin friar, Roger De Jonghe (born 1482, died 1579), kneeling at a
prayer desk on which is an open book.</p>

November 8, 1623, Edward Blount and Isaac Jaggard obtained the
licence of the Stationers’ company for the publication, in the first
folio edition of Shakespeare’s comedies and tragedies, of sixteen
plays, not before printed. Some 265 years later the late Mr. Bernard
Quaritch, in cataloguing a good copy of the completed work, directed
attention to the fact that, based on the then value of the quartos,
the twenty Shakespearian plays actually printed for the first time
in the folio of 1623—for as many were included—would, as first
editions, have a money-worth of from £3,500 to £4,000. All question
of the quartos apart, however, a fine copy of the book, originally
procurable for £1, might now realize from £2,000 to £3,000; indeed,
the mean between these two sums is said to have been privately offered
for a particularly well-known example. No printed book, apart from
about a dozen monuments of typography from fifteenth-century presses,
has fetched so much at auction as the £1,720 realized at Christie’s in
1901 for the Dormer-Hunter first folio, now in the possession of Mr.
Charles Scribner of New York, albeit a few weeks previously £1,475 was
the amount paid on behalf of a transatlantic collector for the scarcer
Bunyan’s ‘Pilgrim’s Progress,’ in first edition, said to have been
issued at 1s. 6d. ¶ That there was ample warrant for the publication of
a new facsimile is acknowledged on all hands; and the folio recently
produced by the Clarendon press has failed in few respects only to
satisfy the most exigent of connoisseurs. The hypercritical observe
that the plate-mark measures no more than 12<span class="fract"><span class="numer">11</span>⁄<span class="denom">16</span></span> in. by 7½ in.,
as against 13⅛, in. by 8⅛ in., the actual size of the pages of the
duke of Devonshire’s copy at Chatsworth, on which the facsimile is
based. On the whole, however, the volume has been cordially welcomed,
and that welcome is merited. ¶ Interest and value are enhanced, of
course, by the scholarly introduction and the census of known extant
copies from the pen of Mr. Sidney Lee. Under his guidance we are
enabled to take a bird’s-eye view of all relevant facts pertaining to
the volume ‘which constitutes the greatest contribution yet made to
English literature.’ Oversights and inaccuracies must of necessity
have crept into the census, for Mr. Lee has been compelled to rely to
a considerable extent, of course, on information supplied to him by
owners and others. But who would have been prepared to undertake a
like task, who would have been able to carry it to a more successful
issue? ¶ Mr. Lee conjectures that the edition of the first folio
consisted of 600 copies, of which not far short of one-third, in
varying states, probably still exist. In 1616 and 1647 respectively
there appeared the collected works of Ben Jonson and of Beaumont and
Fletcher, each issued, he thinks, in about the same number of copies
and at the same price of £1. At the sale of Sir Kenelm Digby’s library
in April 1680 the Beaumont and Fletcher volume fetched 13s. 6d.; the
Ben Jonson, with the folio of 1640 added, 17s. 6d. As most collectors
are aware, the earliest record of the sale by auction of a first folio
Shakespeare is of that in the library of Sir William and the Hon. Henry
Coventry, dispersed in the Haymarket by W. Cooper on May 19, 1687; but,
unfortunately, there is no mention of the sum realized. Mr. Lee states
that the first priced record<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span> belongs to 1756, when the Martin Folkes
example, now in the Rylands library, was sold to George Steevens for 3
guineas. On the other hand, it has been affirmed that in an anonymous
collection of books dispersed in 1687–8 a first folio fetched no more
than 14s. ¶ It is felt that in one direction Mr. Sidney Lee might with
advantage have taken a further step. He has gathered together the
material necessary for making, not only a geographical analysis of the
copies traced, but an analysis which shall show, too, the approximate
condition of those to be found here or there. Of the 600 copies
conjectured to have been printed in 1623, Mr. Lee mentions the present
owners of 144, leaving the possessors of 14., whose particulars do not
agree with those of any others, untraced. The total of 160, including
the two copies named in the postscript, is made up by mention of an
example stated to have been lost in the S.S. <i>Arctic</i>, 1854, and
of that said to have been destroyed in the Chicago fire of 1871. In
order to understand the table that follows, it is necessary in the
first place to transcribe details of the four main classifications into
which Mr. Lee divides the copies he has traced:—</p>

<p>The accompanying table is an attempt to show at a glance the
geographical distribution of the copies named by Mr. Lee. His estimate
of condition has been scrupulously followed, even with regard to
the first folio in the royal library at Berlin. In the <i>Vossische
Zeitung</i> of February 10, and in <i>The Times</i> of the following
day, there appeared a statement to the effect that a careless or
malicious reader had mutilated this Berlin copy, which was bought
of Joseph Lilly in 1858 and presented by the then prince-regent,
afterwards Emperor William I., to the royal library, and that the whole
of the ‘Comedy of Errors’ had been cut out. I communicated with the
director of the library on this subject, and he courteously informs me
that the statement, happily, is based on a misapprehension. The folio
of 1623 is in the same condition as when presented forty-five years
ago; on the other hand, the facsimile of 1806 has been robbed of eight
leaves, including those on which the ‘Comedy of Errors’ is printed. As
to distribution, I have assumed that the five copies sold in the United
States during the past few years have there remained; of the three
examples which occurred at Sotheby’s in 1902 I chance to know that one
has gone to America, another is still in London; while since January
copies LXXVIII<i>a</i>, LXXX, and LXXXVI have been sold at auction and
are entered under ‘London, private owners.’ It is worthy of remark
that the three first folios in British colonies are presentations from
public-spirited men: those at Capetown and Auckland are the gift of Sir
George Grey; that at Sydney of Sir Richard Tangye.</p>

some time past Italian fifteenth-century maiolica has been much
sought after, and very justly; it would appear, however, that, so far,
it is more admired than understood. Without doubt several works have
been devoted to this subject. But if we attempt to divide it up into
several groups, the various classifications seem neither very clear
nor very definitive. ¶ The three druggists’ jars which have just been
acquired by the Louvre will help in a certain degree to fix the date
and to determine the centre of activity of one of the factories which
we are trying to reconstitute at the present moment—a factory which
Mr. Fraschetti has made his special study (in <i>L’ Arte</i>, 1898),
as also Mr. Stettiner has done.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Articles from this factory are
characterized by a decoration of long, large leaves, curving back at
the end, half white and half painted, the veining only being indicated
on the back side; these leaves are intermingled with a peculiar style
of decoration, in which the eyes of peacocks’ feathers are presented
together with large, round, blue and yellow flowers, standing out from
a background of slender blue scroll-pattern. The principal pieces of
this ware have been found at Rome. They are notably the druggists’ jars
of the hospital of St. John Lateran, those of the apothecary Bruti,
near the bridge of S. Angelo, the paving tiles in one of the chapels of
the church of S. Maria del Popolo, and those in the church of S. Maria
della Verità at Viterbo.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> From this fact it has been concluded that
this factory, which sprang more or less directly from Faenza, and which
produced a great deal, must have been situated in Rome; and it has been
proposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span> to call it, at least provisionally, the Roman factory. ¶
The three albarelli in the Louvre belong, as the accompanying figures
will show, to this class, for they are all decorated on one side with
the large peculiar leaves. The most important of these jars, from an
artistic point of view, bears on the front side the bust of a beardless
man, which will at once recall similar figures on the Viterbo pavement.
Before the face waves a streamer,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> upon which the maker (who was
evidently very illiterate) has traced an inscription, which does not
seem to convey any meaning whatever:—AR ·IERIN ·RI · N · E · I · R ·
E. The two other jars are, truth to tell, but very mediocre specimens,
but they are of great interest to the archaeologist, for they are
decorated with armorial shields which furnish us with some very useful
information. On one of these shields are quartered the arms of Aragon
and Jerusalem; on the other are the same arms parti per pale with those
of Milan. These armorial bearings<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> (very distinct though slightly
simplified by the maker, as is generally the case) tell us for whom
these jars were manufactured; they belonged, in fact, to Alfonzo II
of Aragon, king of Naples and Sicily, who reigned one year (from 1494
to 1495) and died in the latter year at the age of forty-seven. He
married in 1465 Hippolyta Maria Sforza (daughter of Francesco Sforza
I, duke of Milan, and Bianca-Maria Visconti), who died at Naples in
1484.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> These albarelli, which bear the coats-of-arms of the king
and queen, must have been made between 1465 and 1484, or at the latest
before 1495.

<p>Therefore they were made for a Neapolitan prince, and,
furthermore, they come from Palermo.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> This would agree very well
with the hypothesis of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
Messrs. Fraschetti and Stettiner, according to whom all the pieces
in this style would be of Roman origin. It would seem natural indeed
that Neapolitan sovereigns should address themselves to a factory in
Rome which was much nearer than those in Faenza or Florence. But, on
the other hand, it must not be forgotten that, even before the end
of the fifteenth century, fanciers sent their orders to very distant
factories, and also that the centres of ceramic industry were much more
numerous in those days than is generally supposed.</p>

<p>The latest acquisitions consist, in the first place, of two large
landscapes by Salomon van Ruysdael. The photographs reproduced avoid
the necessity of a detailed description. One of them is from a
collection at Montpellier, the other from an Austrian collection. They
both present large views of nature, very peaceful and very simple,
banks of wide and sluggish rivers such as the first generation of the
Dutch seventeenth-century landscape men loved to depict. The museum
at Rotterdam possesses a picture by this same van Ruysdael; and we
know that his contemporary, Jan van Goyen, who was his rival rather
than his master, also took a special delight in painting the environs
of that city on the banks of the Maas, with its great sheet of water
spread calmly and majestically under the sky laden with grey or
copper-coloured clouds. Do we find ourselves here in the same environs
of Dordrecht? Probably; although it is impossible to assert this
absolutely. ¶ One thing is certain, which is that the workmanship of
these two pictures very closely approaches that of the other paintings
attributed by modern critics to the uncle of the great Jacob van
Ruysdael, as it does that of many other landscapes of that period.
Although they do not descend to the almost monochrome appearance of
certain van Goyens, brown and yellowish tones predominate, and a
certain and rather monotonous uniformity stands revealed, notably
in the clump of trees that forms the centre of one of the two
compositions. But the moist and cloudy skies are filled with light:
one, in the landscape with the two towers, has gaps through which
appears a pale blue, with rosy streaks in the direction of the horizon;
the other is a little greyer and sadder. A whole crowd of figures, all
standing out clearly against the background, fills the bank and the
river itself, on which barges are carrying herds and shepherds from
one side of the river to the other. A group of horsemen of quality, in
the landscape with the church, reminds us very closely of those which
we see in the Halt at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. This last picture
is dated 1660. But it is much more complicated in composition and more
compact in execution than are our two landscapes at the Louvre. The
latter seem to belong to a less advanced period of the artist’s career,
and are doubtless nearer the Pesth landscape (1631), the first that is
known to us after the artist’s registry on the roll of the gild of St.
Luke at Haarlem. In any case, these are two very fine museum-pieces,
and most worthily represent the earlier of the two Ruysdaels at the
Louvre, where as yet he was hardly represented at all, beside those
unquestionable master-pieces of his nephew, the Dykes, the Thicket,
and the landscape known as the Coup de soleil. ¶ As for the French
picture which is also newly hung, this is the portrait of a woman,
signed ‘L. Tocqué, 1793.’ It was exhibited at the Salon of the same
year, and represents a certain Dame Danger, a perfectly unknown lady.
It was, therefore, no iconographic interest that drew the attention of
the keepers of the Louvre to this portrait, but rather the intrinsic
charm of this very intimate and searching picture of a woman of the
fashionable middle-class of the eighteenth century and the merit of its
very simple and harmonious execution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span> Jean Louis Tocqué was already
abundantly represented at the Louvre, but chiefly by those official
portraits of artist-academicians, of princes and princesses, which
made his fortune, which sent him as far abroad as Sweden, Russia and
Denmark, but which perhaps charm us less to-day than do those simple
and discreet figures which make the society of the eighteenth century
itself live once more before our eyes. This picture has been hung
not far from the supposed portrait of Madame de Graffigny and from
that of a man unknown, by the same artist, and these three figures of
unknown persons, to whom we cannot help ascribing a wealth of wit and
intelligence, form a charming trio together. ¶ The new-comer is engaged
in <i>parfilage</i> or ‘unravelling.’ This occupation was greatly in
fashion at the time; it formed an easy work which kept the fingers busy
without interfering with conversation. The gold threads were separated
from the silks of some piece of lace-work or embroidery and rolled on
a special shuttle (we have preserved some that are marvels of delicate
carving). Neither the eyes nor the mind needed to be kept fixed on this
light labour, as we see in the present case, where the lady, who is no
longer in her first youth under her powdered hair, but who still wears
a seductively young appearance, looks up at her visitor or interlocutor
with a calm and gentle gaze. She wears a grey fur cloak over a
<i>vieux-rose</i> skirt; and the whole forms with the blues of the sofa
on which she is seated a rare and delicate harmony which is one of the
principal qualities of this picture.</p>

<p>In 1902, the Louvre acquired from a French collector residing in Cairo
a piece of Arabic copper incrusted with gold and silver, the beauty
and rarity of which deserve every attention. This piece is the lid
or cover of a <i>koursi</i>, used sometimes as a stool on which the
candlesticks are placed in a mosque, sometimes as a box to contain
the Koran. To prove the rarity of this object I need only mention
that no more than two such stools and one box of metal incrusted with
gold and silver are known. These two famous objects bear the names
of the Sultans Kalaoun and Mohammed el Nasser, and are preserved at
the museum of Arabic art in Cairo. ¶ The <i>koursi</i> cover acquired
by the Louvre is hexagonal in shape, but must originally have been
circular, and formed a plate engraved and incrusted with silver about
the middle of the thirteenth century. This hypothesis is confirmed
by an examination of the reverse side, which allows of an engraved
decoration that would not have been necessary in a real <i>koursi</i>
top fixed to the body of the article itself. The centre, consisting of
a rose with various designs, and the surrounding frieze, containing
an interrupted inscription, give a name—<i>Al Ganâb</i>—and the
following indication: ‘Belonging to Malik al Nasir.’ This title was
common to several sultans in Egypt in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, and does not convey an exact indication of the period. ¶
The inscription is interrupted by six medallions. Their shape and the
pointed arabesques in which they terminate seem characteristic of the
thirteenth century. ¶ Later, in the fourteenth century, the plate
must have been turned and cut out into a hexagon intended to serve
as a <i>koursi</i> cover. The engraved decoration then added to it
is executed with the greatest vigour and clearness, and is rich in
incrustations in gold and silver. In the centre is a long inscription
with radiating letters giving the customary titles of the contemporary
sultan, the sacred names of God, the great, the sole, the glorious.
This fine radiating inscription is peculiar, through its character and
the decorative importance of the letters, to the art of the Egyptian
engravers on copper of the fourteenth century.</p>

the art of weaving textile fabrics was known and practised among
the earliest civilized nations of the world appears to be beyond
dispute. Primarily no doubt the need for some form of clothing (slight
probably in a hot country) and for floor coverings which should afford
a protection against scorpions and other venomous creatures and for
sleeping mats called forth the production of cloths woven from reeds
and grasses and from the fibres of large-leaved plants. Soon, however,
the possibility of using the wool of goats and sheep and camels must
have impressed itself on the minds of primitive weavers, and from this
to the production of textiles proper was but a short and easy step
in natural development. It is probable that a considerable time may
have elapsed between the first production of woven fabrics and the
time when the artistic need became felt for enhancing their appearance
by the employment of colouring matters. The mind of the primitive
manufacturer became no doubt gradually attuned to this necessity by
the slow development of a natural desire to brighten the gloomy aspect
of his darkened homes. (In this regard it will be borne in mind that
an essential feature of all oriental interiors has ever been the
exclusion, so far as may be, of the scorching glare of the sun’s rays.)
The primitive houses of the earliest settled peoples were doubtless
built of mud, as are those of their descendants to-day, and it would
be difficult to imagine anything less attractive than the interior of
an Upper Egypt, or Nubian or Mesopotamian house (which is to-day the
exact counterpart of those we find on the paintings and bas-reliefs
which have come down to us from the oldest times), with mud walls, mud
floor, mud roof, all of a uniform dingy brown, and without furniture
of any kind to relieve the eye. It is probable that the early weaver
was in the habit of dyeing his woven products in some uniform colour
for a considerable time before it occurred to him that richer effects
might be produced by colouring his yarns in different tints previous to
their employment on the loom. Having got so far it did not take very
long before his manual dexterity had so far attained the level of his
artistic aspirations as to impel him to seek models for the complicated
designs he sought to introduce into his work. For these models, as
for their colouring, he naturally turned to those forms which were
constantly before his eyes in everyday life.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_349d.jpg" alt="Lotus 1">
</div>

<p>And among
these most prominent no doubt was the lotus, which in one form or the
other is invariably found to hold a prominent place in the centre or
border of an oriental carpet. Probably the artistic weaver copied the
numerous forms of the lotus long before he attached any symbolism to
the plant itself, and merely because the flowing lines and sweeping
curves of the plant appealed to his eye. Other tree and plant forms
there were no doubt that commended themselves to him, and these, too,
he sought to introduce into his designs; but the predominance of the
lotus over all other forms early asserted itself and has maintained its
position ever since. At what period the profound and mystic symbolism
of the lotus became generally recognized among the peoples to whom it
was a familiar object must ever remain a matter of controversy and
of speculation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span> Professor Goodyear, who has written an elaborate
treatise on ‘The Grammar of the Lotus,’ regards this form of classic
and ancient ornamentation as a development of sun worship. His theory
briefly deals with the development of the sun symbols from the lotus by
a series of complicated and ingenious evolutions. The lotus, according
to him, was a fetish of immemorial antiquity, which has been worshipped
in many countries from Japan to Gibraltar. He claims that it is the
symbol of life, immortality, renaissance, resurrection and fecundity.
He describes the three forms of lotus: the blue and the white, which
differ but little save in colour, and the rose lotus, which is really
not a lotus at all botanically speaking, and is not a native of Egypt
but of India.</p>

<div class="figleft illowe14" id="i_350">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_350.jpg" alt="Lotus 2">
</div>

<p>This lotus (the rose) is still cultivated
in China as a food plant, and it is believed that it was brought to
Egypt from India by Alexander the Great for that purpose; but that
it was regarded by the Egyptians as a national symbol there is, in
the opinion of Professor Goodyear, no sufficient evidence to show.
¶That the lotus was early regarded as a religious symbol in India and
China is generally held. It is, of course, the sacred flower of the
Buddhists. ‘When Buddha was born,’ says Moor in his ‘Hindu Pantheon,’
‘a lotus bloomed where he first touched the ground; he stepped seven
steps northward, and a lotus marked each foot-fall.’ The Buddhist
prayer often quoted begins: ‘O God, the jewel of the lotus,’ or ‘O
holy jewel in the lotus, be it so.’ In the Hindu theogony the lotus
floating on the water is an emblem of the world, and the whole plant
of the earth and its two principles of fecundation. Edwin Arnold, in
‘The Light of Asia,’ says: ‘Aum Mani pâdme hûm,’ of which the literal
translation is, ‘All hail to the jewel in the flower of the lotus.’ He
continues: ‘The sunrise comes,’ ‘The dew-drop slips,’ ‘Into the shining
sea.’ ¶ Brahmans consider the sun to be the emblem or image of their
great deities, jointly or individually, <i>i.e.</i> Brahma the supreme
one, who alone exists really and absolutely. The legend goes that
Brahma, according to a generally received system founded on a doctrine
of the Vaishnavas, sprang on a lotus from the navel of Vishnu, who is
the personification of the sun, to bid all worlds exist. ¶ Professor
Goodyear maintains that the symbolism of the lotus, which is referred
most frequently by modern writers to its phallic and generative or to
its funereal and mortuary bearings, is based upon well-proved but not
generally recognized solar significance. The easiest way to demonstrate
this is by an appeal to the acknowledged fact that the Egyptian idea of
the resurrection and of a future life was connected with the worship of
the creative and reproductive forces of nature, which were conceived
and worshipped as solar in character and origin. It is the supposed
passage of the sun at night through a lower world during its return
to the dawn of a following day which makes Osiris (the sun at night)
the god of the lower world and of the dead, for which reason he is
represented as a mummy. As the god of resurrection, the special and
emphatic character of Osiris, he represents the creative power of the
sun god; and thus the lotus, as the attribute of Osiris, is at once a
symbol of the sun of resurrection, and of creative force and power.</p>

<p>Professor Goodyear further contends that the lotus, which he holds,
as has been said, to be the keynote of decoration, is identical with
the tree of life, or rather that the accepted tree of life is really a
variant of the lotus in one form or the other of its many aspects. He
objects to the theory that the date palm, the palmetta, or the papyrus
is invariably the tree of life, as is held by several writers.¶
The weakness of the theory regarding the soma tree or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
hom (date-palm) as the tree of life is not only the weakness of the
palm theory, which is that no transitional forms between the palmetta
and palm can be shown in Assyrian art and that they are not known to
have grown there, because it is not to be denied that the sacred tree
of Assyria<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> was the palm, but it is a pure hypothesis to suppose
that all were soma trees.</p>

<div class="figright illowe20" id="i_353a">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_353a.jpg" alt="Lotus 3">
</div>

<p>The Assyrian tree of life, he
holds, was really an artificial form of the lotus, which plant was as
well known in Assyria as in India. Sir George Birdwood, who gives a
lengthy list of trees held sacred in one part or another of the east,
is more or less emphatic as to the hom or soma, which he says is the
date-palm, being the tree of life. He allows, however, that on Yarkand
rugs the tree of life is represented by a pomegranate tree. As against
this, Sayce, in one of the Hibbert lectures, as quoted by Goodyear,
says that, ‘the cedar tree is identified with the tree of life,’ and
‘the palm is possibly later.’ The palm, he adds, is undoubtedly a
symbol on Assyrian and Chaldean cylinders, as illustrated in Layard’s
‘Culte du Methra,’ but Goodyear does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span> think that Layard’s text
would give much support to the theory of ornamental palm symbolism in
Assyria. Count Goblet d’Alviella, in his work on ‘La Migration des
Symboles,’ bears out Goodyear and Sayce, and, to some extent, even
Birdwood, as to the locality where the tree of life had its origin;
but albeit he describes what he holds to be its early representation,
he does not attempt to establish a theory as to what was the tree
originally typified. The sacred tree, he says, is one of the earliest
historic symbols (note he does not call it the tree of life) and had
its origin in Mesopotamia; it passed thence to India, where it was
used by Buddhists and Brahmans, and thence again to the Phoenicians,
and from Asia Minor to Greece. From Persia it was introduced to the
Byzantines, and found its way in early Christian times into Christian
symbolism in Sicily, Italy, and even in the west of France. ¶ The
earliest type, he claims, was a tree of complex and ornate pattern,
having on either side of it a monster who faced each the other. These
had the forms of winged bulls or of griffins.</p>

<div class="figleft illowe11" id="i_353b">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_353b.jpg" alt="Lotus 4">
</div>

<p>Another type, which was that of the semi-human or human priests and kings,
followed the same route into China and India and eastern Asia, and
being found in the ancient Mexican and Maga codices, is held by Goblet
d’Alviella as a part of the evidence which he cites in support of his
theory of a pre-Columbian communication between the old world and
the new. ¶ As opposed to Sir George Birdwood’s theory that the soma
or hom is a date-palm, it may be pointed out that other authorities
who are not less entitled to speak on the subject declare the soma
of the Vedas<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and the hom of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span> Zendavesta<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> to be the
<i>Sarcostemma viminale</i>, a leafless asclepiad with white flowers
in terminal umbels which appear during the rains in the Dekhan. The
flower obtains its name apparently from the fact that it is gathered
by moonlight (presumably the full moon), the sanskrit word for the
moon being <i>soma</i>. Its conveyance home in carts drawn by rams is
accompanied by ceremonials. A fermented liquor is obtained from the
flower by mixing its juice, which has been strained through a sieve
of goats’ hair, with a preparation of barley and clarified butter or
ghee. This beer or wine is used at religious festivals; it may be said
that according to Hindu superstition the gods of their system can do
nothing without having been previously stimulated with soma. In the
second hymn of the Rigveda occurs this passage: ‘Approach, O Wayu; be
visible; this Soma juice has been prepared for thee; approach, drink,
hear our invocation.’ Many indeed are the allusions made in religious
ceremonials to the invigorating power and even intoxicating qualities
of the soma, as to which Windischmann suggests that the plant was
identical with the gogard tree, which has the quality of ‘enlightening
the eyes’ and which he compares with Ampelus, the vine of Bacchus.
This same beverage is used at their meals by the Muhammedan Rishis in
Kashmir, who abstain from animal food and from marriage. It may be
said that Soma, as well as being the name of a tree, to which it may
afterwards well have been given, is in the Hindo mythology the name of
the son of Rishi Atri by his wife Anasuga (he is also said to be the
son of Dharma and Prabhakara). He married the twenty-seven daughters
of Daksha (which are the twenty-seven lunar asterisms). He also
carried off Tara the wife of Brihaspati, who bore him a son and named
him Buddha. This Buddha is regarded as being the parent of the lunar
race. Thus are we inevitably brought back to Buddha and Buddhistic
emblems and to the long-vanished origins from which those emblems were
derived. The lotus, none have disputed, is the oldest known attribute
of Buddhist symbolism, but is it not equally certain that the lotus
existed in remote ages long antecedent to the dawn of Buddhism? Here
then is matter which makes for the support of Professor Goodyear’s
ingenious theory. He takes the sepals of the lotus in their natural
form, he shows how they have been twisted and exaggerated into spirals
and volutes, which, being squared on their passage through the Ionic
style of architecture, formed at length what is known as the meander,
Greek fret or key pattern, which being doubled produces the svastika.
The svastika therefore, which every authority has acknowledged to be
the most ancient expression of symbolism, as it is also the earliest
form of ornamentation known to the world, should in accordance with
this be regarded as identical with the lotus symbol in one of its many
phases.</p>

the notice of a mediaeval chalice from Iceland in the June number of
this <span class="smcap">Magazine</span> (p. 70), mention was made, by way of comparison,
of the silver chalice found in 1827 at Sorö, Denmark, in the grave
of Absalon, bishop of Lund, who died in the year 1201. A view of
this exceptionally interesting specimen of early Scandinavian work,
still preserved in the church of Sorö, is shown in the accompanying
illustration.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The character of the chalice, as revealed by the
photograph, confirms the close relationship existing between it and
the example which was the subject of the notice alluded to. The bowl
nearly hemispherical in shape, the flattened globular knop, and
the trumpet-shaped foot with bevelled margin finishing in a narrow
turned-out edge, are the salient features of each alike. A point of
distinction not quite so apparent in the engraving which was referred
to<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> is the somewhat greater width in proportion to height of
the Sorö chalice, giving a rather more spreading shape of bowl and
foot. The bowl, too, is seen to have less of the tendency towards a
straightening of the contour at its upper part, which, in the example
from Iceland, seems to give a hint of the coming change of shape, an
indication which suggests the lapse of a certain interval between their
dates. The necking between the knop and bowl, on the other hand, is now
shown to be of very similar proportions in both. This necking (called
by Theophilus the ‘ring’) and the band below the knop are enriched
with shallow fluting, somewhat hidden by the shadow in the photograph;
the foot appears to have suffered injury from crushing. ¶ Certain
features, such as the fully-expanded knop with enrichment above and
below, and the fairly substantial character of the work apparent in the
thickness at the edge of the foot, support the belief that the subject
of the present illustration is an actual mass-chalice.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Whether
made for service at the altar or merely for mortuary use the chalice is
equally valuable as an example of the shape arrived at in Scandinavia
in or before the year 1201.</p>

<h3 id="The_Oaken_Chest_of_Ypres">THE OAKEN CHEST OF YPRES</h3>

<p>This chest of massive oak belongs to the office of archives at Ypres.
It is perhaps the most curious and characteristic example of a kind
familiar to antiquaries. In the middle panel, cut deep into the oak,
St. George charges stoutly at the dragon, whose throat is stricken
through with the lance. St. George’s head has a basnet, whose point
ends in a socket with a feather stuck in it. This basnet has the camail
and roundels over the ears. Over his hawberk the saint wears a short
coat with long sleeves, wide and slittered at the edges. The saddle,
with its great rolled guards for the legs, is noteworthy. The dragon
is no writhing worm under the horse-hoofs, but a fearsome thing like
to a mad bull-calf, a thing begotten of bull and serpent. Behind the
monster stands Dame Cleodolinde, daintily lifting her skirt and no
whit uneasy for the hurtling of horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span> and dragon. Behind her are the
town walls, with towers and halls above them. Out of frilled clouds
over St. George’s head a divine arm is thrust, in a loose sleeve,
with two fingers blessing the lance-thrust. In the broad uprights
at the chest-end a gentleman and a lady in full round sleeves stand
between pillars. Above them are battlements, and above the battlements
mullioned windows. ¶ The broad lock of this chest remains, a lock of
most interesting form. The whole chest was once painted in colours,
traces of which remain here and there. When the fashion of the dresses
and arms have been reckoned over, and something allowed for craft
tradition, the chest would seem to be of the early years of the
fifteenth century, although it came to the famous exhibition of 1902 at
Bruges most absurdly labelled and catalogued as of the thirteenth.</p>

<h3 id="A_Burgundian_Chest">A BURGUNDIAN CHEST</h3>

<p>This great chest, which was shown at Bruges in 1902, is a noble example
of the Burgundian school of wood-carving, its ornament offering sharp
contrast with the English manner. ¶ The four panels of the front and
three of the uprights are filled with rich carving of traceries and
arabesques, but the chisel has stayed at the framework, and the chest,
for all the richness of its ornament, loses nothing of its massive
and sturdy appearance. The end panels are plain, and the plain cover
is slightly arched in remembrance of the waggon tops of the earlier
coffers. The first panel has a little shield of St. Peter’s keys,
with the pope’s triple crown very large above it. The second has the
emperor’s shield of the eagle with two necks surmounted by an open
crown. Another crowned shield bears the famous badge of Burgundy, the
steel, or strike-a-light, with its flint and sparks. The fourth panel
has neither crown nor shield, but the tracery shapes itself into three
fleurs-de-lys, which, although they be not upon a shield, may stand for
the king of France. Thus the four panels show pope, emperor, duke and
king. On the broad upright in the middle is a crown above a tiny shield
charged with a single fleur-de-lys. It will be seen that the armorial
decoration is poorly-conceived stuff to be set upon these rich panels.
Especially is this feebleness manifest in the starveling fowl of the
emperor’s shield. ¶ The chest is of the latter half of the fifteenth
century. It is the property of the ‘hospices civils’ of Aalst.</p>

<h3 id="A_New_Fount_of_Greek_Type">A NEW FOUNT OF GREEK TYPE</h3>

<p>The Greek type of which a specimen is shown on page 359 is based on
the celebrated Alcalà fount of 1514. This was cut by order of Cardinal
Ximenes for use in the New Testament of the great Complutensian
polyglot Bible, and is usually supposed, though there is no direct
evidence, to owe its form to an ancient manuscript which was sent to
Spain by Leo X from the Vatican library to serve as the basis for the
text of the New Testament in that work. The printer, Arnaldo Guillen
de Brocar, asserts in his preface that the type was designed to do
special honour to the original language of the Gospels. The present
type is adapted from this Alcalà fount with little alteration, as far
as the lower case is concerned, the chief change beyond an increase
in size being as follows. The New Testament of 1514 was printed with
no accents except the acute, and the body of the type was adjusted
to this condition. But when Guillen came to print other books (the
‘Chrysoloras’ of the same year, the undated ‘Hero and Leander,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span> and
one or two others), he found it necessary to provide a complete set of
accents, and as the body of the type was not high enough to give room
for the tallest of these, he was compelled, in order to avoid recasting
the whole fount, to hang these over the line above by means of what are
called kerns. The result of this is that while the page produces a very
fine solid effect, the lines are too close to each other for comfort in
reading. This has been avoided in the new type by taking the tallest
combination as the standard of height, and thus increasing the whites
between the lines, with a corresponding increase of readableness. But
the Alcalà type had only one capital letter, a <span class="smaller">Π</span>, and it has
been necessary to design the whole of the capitals for the new type, as
no good models were available. The capitals have in fact always been
the weakest point in Greek types. The points and other minor features
are also new. ¶ The punches have been cut for Mr. Robert Proctor by Mr.
E. P. Prince, who cut the punches for the Kelmscott, Doves, and other
special founts, from drawings prepared by Messrs. Walker and Cockerell,
and the type has been cast on a double-pica body by Messrs. Miller and
Richard, of Edinburgh, the vowels and accents being made separately,
and contrived by means of overhangs to combine into a single sort. It
is proposed to use this, which will be called the Otter type, for the
production of books representative of Greek literature of all periods,
ancient, mediaeval, and modern. They will be printed by a hand-press
on special hand-made paper in red and black, and no effort will be
spared to give, in most cases for the first time since the invention
of printing, a form worthy of them to the masterpieces of the greatest
classical literature of the world. The first volume, which will
probably appear in the autumn of this year, is to be the ‘Oresteia’ of
Aeschylus, a quarto of some 250 pages.</p>

important and interesting portrait by Rembrandt which is here
reproduced has justly been given a place of honour among the works
of that master now being shown in the exhibition of portraits by old
masters at the Hague; indeed, in the opinion of many good critics it
is one of the greatest attractions at the Kunstkring. Since permission
was given to us by Messrs. Dowdeswell to reproduce the picture, it has
passed out of their hands into those of Mr. Hage, a Dutch collector, by
whom it has been lent to the Hague exhibition; it was formerly in the
collection of Sir Matthew Wilson. The panel, which is 30 by 23¼ inches,
was painted in the same year as The Anatomy Lesson, when Rembrandt was
only twenty-six years old, and belongs, therefore, to his earliest
period; that this is the case is proved by the signature on the right
of the picture, ‘R. H. L. van Rijn 1632.’ The identity of the lady who
is the subject of the portrait has not yet been established, and beyond
the fact stated on the picture itself that she was thirty-nine at the
time it was painted we know nothing about her. It is unnecessary to
expatiate on the merits of the picture, which speaks for itself even in
the reproduction.</p>

<p>The oil painting by Daubigny and the pastel by Lhermitte, of which we
publish reproductions by kind permission of Mr. John Balli, are good
examples of the work of the two French artists. They are among the
pictures which have recently been exhibited at Mr. McLean’s gallery
for the benefit of that excellent institution, the artists’ benevolent
fund.</p>

<h3>T<span class="smaller">HE</span> A<span class="smaller">MBASSADORS</span>
U<span class="smaller">NRIDDLED</span>. By W. F. Dickes. London: Cassells.</h3>

<p>M<span class="smaller">R</span>. D<span class="smaller">ICKES</span> has been ill-advised to repeat and amplify, as he
has done in this volume, a theory concerning Holbein’s picture of The
Ambassadors of which all competent students recognized the futility
when it was first broached in <i>The Magazine of Art</i> a dozen years
ago. Since then the subject and history of the picture have been
completely elucidated by Miss Mary Hervey in a book published in 1895.
Her work is a model of patient, sagacious and fortunate industry. No
links of any consequence are wanting in the chain of evidence, internal
and external, by which she has made it certain that the portraits in
the picture are those of two leading French diplomatists of the time,
the one a man of the sword and the other of the robe, viz.: Jean de
Dinteville, bailly of Troyes, and his friend, George de Selve, bishop
of Lavaur; that the picture was painted by Holbein in London when the
two friends were here together in the spring of 1533; and that it is
the identical work described in three perfectly authentic documents
of the mid-seventeenth century as having been preserved down to that
date at Polisy, the seat of the Dinteville family in Champagne.
The traditional name of the picture in the eighteenth century, The
Ambassadors, is thus completely justified. Of one ambassador, M. de
Selve, tradition had also quite rightly preserved the name; while of
the other, Jean de Dinteville, the name had been lost; and the name
D’Avaux, which belonged to a diplomatic family of a later generation,
had been substituted mistakenly. It is the pleasure of Mr. Dickes to
ignore these proofs, and to assert a rival theory for which there is
not a shadow either of antecedent likelihood or of genuine evidence,
while it is flatly at variance with tradition. His work, the result
of no small industry and application of a blundering kind, is a
pathetic example of the fate which awaits an untrained inquirer who
has become possessed by an <i>idée fixe</i> and insists on burrowing
with obstinate blindness in a hopelessly wrong direction. Kindness
would suggest that such a performance should be ignored; but as its
illusory air of candour and research has actually misled some unwary
critics, let it be dealt with here as briefly and gently as the case
admits. ¶ The theory of Mr. Dickes is that the picture represents the
two German brothers, Otto Henry and Philip, counts palatine of the
Rhine, who had their residence at Neuburg and were known as dukes
of Neuburg, and that it was painted in celebration of a treaty of
Nuremberg concluded between the Catholic and Protestant princes of
Germany in 1532. The road by which the author has arrived at this
conclusion is somewhat as follows: A conspicuous feature in the picture
is a lute with a broken string. In Alciati’s famous book of Emblems,
of which the first extant edition was published at Augsburg in 1531
(though some of the emblems had previously been in circulation,
most probably in manuscript), a lute is the symbol of a treaty. Or
rather it is the symbol of a particular group of treaties, <i>Foedera
Italorum</i>; in all probability the league of Cognac, which in 1626
united the princes of Italy with France and England against the
emperor. A set of Latin verses accompanies the emblem, and declares,
among other things, that if a single string should be ill-stretched or
broken, all power of pleasing will depart out of the instrument and
its excellent music will become jangled. Obviously, therefore, if the
lute with the broken string in Holbein’s picture has anything to do
with Alciati and his emblems at all, it must signify a treaty broken
and not a treaty made and confirmed. Mr. Dickes shuts his eyes to this
root fact of the case, and builds all his argument on the patently
false supposition that it is the emblem of a treaty signed and valid.
Having further, on no reasonable grounds whatever, satisfied himself
that the picture represents two brothers of whom one is Catholic and
the other Protestant, he hunts up his history of the Reformation, and
learns about the treaty of Nuremberg and the concern in it of the two
brothers, Counts Otto Henry and Philip. From that moment it becomes a
fixed dogma with him that these are the persons represented, and all
facts and evidences have to be pulled about like putty in order to
prove it. Thus the inscriptions on the picture, which are perfectly
genuine, declare that Holbein painted it in 1533, and that at that
date the age of the lay personage in short cloak, sword and dagger
was twenty-nine, and of the clerical or legal personage in square cap
and velvet gown, twenty-five. These indications absolutely fit alike
the date of Dinteville’s mission, that of Selve’s visit, and those
of Dinteville’s birth and Selve’s birth. But they are hopelessly out
for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span> Counts Otto Henry and Philip. So it costs Mr. Dickes nothing to
declare the inscription with the artist’s name and the date a forgery;
when in fact it has been proved unquestionably genuine by the test of
the same caretul processes which cleared away the dirt and accretions
of time from other details in the work. Agreeing that the picture was
painted in 1533 (for which there is no evidence at all except this same
impeached inscription), Mr. Dickes then assumes the arbitrary date 1532
(that of the signature of his Nuremberg treaty) from which to calculate
the ages of the sitters. Even so he cannot get them right, Otto Henry
having been born in 1502 and Philip in 1503. The former thus still
remains one year and the latter five years too old; so that in the case
of Philip the figure 25 has to be declared, again without a shadow
of foundation, to have been altered. ¶ Once more, the lay ambassador
in the ordinary court dress of the time, short cloak, sword and
dagger and tasselled belt, wears the badge of the French order of St.
Michael, thus confirming the tradition and the probability that he was
a Frenchman. This would be fatal to Mr. Dickes’s theory, so it has to
be made out that the badge is not that of the famous order at all. For
this Mr. Dickes has no better proof than that it is not identical with
the same order as figured about a century later in Favyn’s ‘Théâtre
d’Honneur et de Chevalerie.’ But there was no mechanical uniformity
in the badge of the order as worn by its members, and still less in
its representation by artists supplying their portraits. All students
of French sixteenth-century portraiture, whether painted or engraved,
can easily recall a dozen or a score of variations in the badge; while
no such student could have a moment’s doubt that Holbein’s sitter,
whatever else he was or was not, is declared by this badge to be a
knight of the order. This is again one of the cardinal facts by which
an inquirer must be guided, and to contradict it as Mr. Dickes does
is merely idle. ¶ Again, Miss Hervey discovered in a Paris curiosity
shop in 1895, and presented to the National gallery, a docketed
seventeenth-century document on parchment fully describing the picture
and its contents. Mr. Dickes at the time attacked the authenticity of
this document in detail, on grounds which to any trained paleographer
are ridiculous. In his book he does not reprint his arguments, but in
an innocently impertinent dedication to the trustees of the National
gallery coolly puts it aside as ‘supposititious.’ In point of fact it
has no flaw whatever except that it is destructive of his theory. But
worse: Miss Hervey, whose methods are as sound and scrupulous as those
of Mr. Dickes are the reverse, also found in the library of the French
Institute two other documents of the seventeenth century minutely
confirming the contents of the first: these are papers of the Godefroy
family relating to a correspondence between themselves and Nicholas
Camusat, the well-known antiquary of Troyes, who had made it his
business to collect historical and archaeological traditions concerning
his native town and its distinguished families, including that of
Dinteville. These documents are too irrefutable to be contested: Mr.
Dickes therefore placidly ignores them. In like manner, in trying to
show, what his theory requires, that the picture was painted not in
London but in Germany, he ignores Miss Hervey’s proof that the pavement
is copied strictly from one still extant in Westminster abbey. As a
point on his side, he quotes as having been painted by Holbein at
Basle in 1533 a picture of a Wheel of Fortune ‘in the collection of
the duke of Westminster.’ The picture he means belongs in fact to
the duke of Devonshire, and was painted by Hans Schäufelein; whose
monogram and mark of a shovel have been tampered with but are still
clearly discernible, and whose style is quite unlike that of Holbein.
One more instance may suffice for the illustration of this gentleman’s
incredible method of dealing with the evidences which substantiate
the real meaning and contents of the picture. Among the instruments
on the table symbolical of the arts to which these two cultivated
and liberal young diplomatists were devoted, is a small hand globe,
which has been identified as copied, with the addition of a certain
number of place-names, from that published by Schöner at Nuremberg in
1523. On this globe the name of Nuremberg appears conspicuously, as of
course is natural, since that was its place of publication. Mr. Dickes
at once reads this as an evidence for his theory that the picture is
meant to celebrate the peace of Nuremberg. Among the place-names added
by the painter to those which were inserted by the cartographer are
three of German provinces, four of Spanish provinces, five of French
provinces, and three of French towns, Paris, Lyons and Bayonne, besides
one which is that of Dinteville’s own village and fief in Champagne,
Polisy (the s a little broken by a crack in the panel). These additions
are exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span> what might have been expected to be dictated by a French
diplomatist engaged in the combinations of his country at the time with
Spain and Italy, while the insertion of Polisy is of course a final
link in the proof that the lay ambassador is no other than Dinteville.
This insertion is promptly and without a shadow of reason declared by
Mr. Dickes an eighteenth-century forgery. ¶ Now for an instance of
the kind of evidence with which this critic tries to support his own
theory. Dinteville in the picture wears a girdle with a rich tassel
hanging at the front. So do a number of great gentlemen in portraits
of this time; as for instance the well-known Earl of Surrey at Hampton
Court, and the sitter in the famous portrait of Morett in the gallery
at Dresden. But Mr. Dickes thinks it a great point for his argument
that a tassel (though one, as he does not mention, of other colours)
was among the quarterings in the arms of his counts palatine. So he
not only ignores its habitual use in the fashions of the day; he
maintains that the Dresden picture, in which the sitter also wears the
tassel, is another and later portrait of the same Count Otto Henry, and
that it was painted not by Holbein but long after Holbein’s death by
Christoph Amberger. The suggestion is merely preposterous: the Dresden
picture is not only by Holbein, but one of the very finest and the
most central of his works, of far finer artistic quality, indeed, than
our National gallery picture; and the features have no resemblance
to those of Dinteville (Mr. Dickes’s Otto Henry) in the London
picture except in the mere fashion of the hair and beard. Moreover,
the identity of the sitter in the Dresden picture as another French
ambassador to England, Charles de Soliers, sieur de Morette, has lately
been put out of the possibility of doubt by the discovery of a fine
contemporary medallion portrait of the same sitter, in boxwood, with
his name and titles in full and on the back his device of a seaport, a
horse, and a dolphin. ¶ But why pursue the ungrateful subject farther?
Mr. Dickes’s book bristles on every page with similar absurdities
of statement and of inference. Fortunately, for any qualified and
careful reader, he sometimes provides an antidote against his own
theories by himself furnishing the obvious means of their refutation.
Nothing, for instance, could be more grotesque than the collection
of different and totally unlike portraits which he has picked out of
various galleries in Europe, and would persuade us to accept as all
representing the valiant Count Philip, the defender of Vienna. The
mere possibility of his taking all these, together with the French
cleric in The Ambassadors, for one and the same person, would seem to
argue him form-blind in the same degree as the whole tenour of his book
unfortunately argues him fact-blind and evidence-proof.</p>

<p>Being at Veere some years ago, and finding that I had a few hours at
my disposal before the members of the gild of St. Thomas and St. Luke
could arrive, I bethought me of the local archives, which I fancied
would probably contain documents throwing light on the history and
works of Gossart. I found the archives in confusion, and was not
so fortunate as to discover anything. I had hoped on taking up the
present volume to find that the author had been more fortunate, but,
alas, it contains no mention of these archives, which probably still
await the visit of someone with leisure and patience to devote to
their examination. It is a pity that M. Gossart has not been able to
undertake this; still we must be thankful for what he has done. Any
attempt to clear up the history of an artist of note, especially of
one to whom many works are attributed, is deserving of praise and
encouragement. The settling of the date of Gossart’s visit to Italy
with Philip of Burgundy and of his death are two important additions
to our knowledge. ¶ John Gossart, son of Simon, a bookbinder, was
born at Maubeuge about 1472. It is not known when or to whom he was
apprenticed, or where he worked prior to 1503, in which year he was
admitted as free master into the gild of St. Luke at Antwerp. In
1508 he went to Rome with his patron, Philip of Burgundy, admiral of
Flanders, who was sent by the Archduchess Margaret on an embassy to
Pope Julius II. Starting from Mechlin on October 26, 1508, they visited
Verona and Florence on their way to the Eternal City, where, after the
return of Philip, Gossart remained copying antique works of art for
him until July 1509, when he set out for the Netherlands, arriving at
Middleburg in November. ¶ He remained in the service of Philip until
the death of that prince in 1524, and then entered that of Adolphus of
Burgundy, marquis of Veere, with whom he remained until his death in
1533. So far good, and had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span> author stopped here we should have had
no fault to find with him, but he has endeavoured to draw up a list of
Gossart’s paintings, a task for which he is evidently little fitted.
Not only has he omitted several important works, such as the early
picture in the Prado gallery, but he has included others which bear no
resemblance to those painted by Gossart, or which never pretended to
be other than copies, being honestly signed by the copyist ‘Malbodius
inventor’; he has enumerated pictures as being now in private
collections which were dispersed more than fifty years ago, and has
described the same picture twice over (pp. 66 and 68) under different
titles, having apparently copied out or translated any notices he has
come across, and this with very little care, as his pages not only
swarm with errors of spelling but also of fact, such as the monstrous
absurdity that Gossart (p. 63) painted the portrait of ‘Van den
<i>Rust</i>, <i>Carmélite</i>, qui recueillit Memlinc à la bataille de
Nancy.’</p>

Engraved by Timothy Cole. Macmillan.</h3>

<p>This hook contains some of Mr. Timothy Cole’s most accomplished work.
The preface certainly does not exaggerate his merits when it says
that no other engraver of the day could transpose into the medium of
wood engraving so much of the spirit and even of the actual quality
of the original pictures. Whether, as is also claimed, his engravings
are of more value as records and reminiscences of the paintings than
good photogravures we doubt. For any purposes of study photographic
processes with all their drawbacks are essential. But there is much to
be said for interpretative engraving when it reaches so high a point
of excellence as Mr. Cole’s. For when we look at a photograph or a
photogravure, however good, we enjoy, not the thing before our eyes,
but the vision of the original, which, even if we have never seen it,
we imaginatively construct. Our enjoyment is at one remove from our
actual sensations, but when we look at one of Mr. Cole’s finer pieces
we get an immediate pleasure from the discriminating and appreciative
tact of the translator, from the rare mastery of a difficult medium
which he shows, and this pleasure is superadded to a very vivid sense
of the beauty of the original. Moreover, in certain instances, his
power of suggesting luminous and transparent depth of colour or of
hinting at subtle gradations of tone goes almost beyond the reach of
photographic reproduction. It is not a little surprising that in
a medium so precise as wood engraving Mr. Cole’s most distinctive
excellence lies not in his rendering of design of definite form so much
as in his power of giving atmospheric suffusion and infinitely subtle
gradations of tone and of suggesting colour. There are, indeed, not
a few cases where the form is too much lost, where the searched-out
design of the original disappears in a vague penumbra; many cases,
too, where the contour is unduly wavering and shapeless: on the other
hand, where the chiaroscuro is most subtle, where the gradations would
seem to defy any analysis into lines and dots, Mr. Cole surpasses
himself. The face of Gainsborough’s Mrs. Graham is quite marvellous
in this respect, while for atmospheric quality it would be impossible
to surpass the Wilsons. With Reynolds he is less successful. Romney’s
Parson’s Daughter is another excellent engraving; and here again it
is the evasive liquid brush stroke which he understands so perfectly.
Raeburn’s Lord Newton, in which similar qualities predominate, is
again admirably rendered. We doubt whether this method of reproducing
works of art will be continued in the future, nor do we particularly
desire it. The finest qualities of wood engraving as an independent
art are really contradictory to such methods as are necessary for the
faithful transcription of oil painting, but the American school of wood
engraving will nevertheless be remembered for the perfect attainment of
its best aims in Mr. Cole’s work.</p>

July.—<i>La Sculpture beige et
les influences françaises. By M. Raymond Kœchlin.</i>—The author
endeavours to show that the realistic tendencies hitherto supposed to
be indigenous in Flemish art from its commencement did not in reality
declare themselves till the end of the fourteenth and beginning of
the fifteenth centuries. In the twelfth century German influence
predominated at all events in Mosan art, but was succeeded in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries by the decisive influence of
French figure sculpture. Belgian art was at this period informed by
the same idealistic and generalizing tendencies as the French school
from which it derived. M. Kœchlin makes his point good by a number of
interesting examples, but in his anxiety to proclaim French influence
he minimizes the distinctions between the two schools,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span> the shorter
proportions, the blunter and more angular modelling of the Belgian
sculptors. If the effigy of Blanche of Castile which came from Tournai
to St. Denys is really—as M. Pit supposes—a work of the thirteenth
century, it shows that already the Flemings were beginning that angular
and cutting treatment of the folds of drapery which is associated with
the realistic art of the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and
which the French did not accept till a much later date. <i>Quelques
réflexions sur les Salons.</i> (<i>Second, concluding article.</i>)
<i>By M. Henry Cochin.</i>—This is as brilliantly and fascinatingly
written as the first article, and is, like it, pleasantly discursive.
M. Cochin discusses with stimulating suggestiveness the theory that
every work of art is a symbol, a sign in a universal language, a
token corresponding with spiritual and mental values. He proceeds to
elaborate the very tenable thesis that all portraiture is caricature,
and justly praises in this connection M. Weber’s satiric comedies.
His remarks on the ‘modern style,’ as the French call it, or ‘l’art
nouveau’ as we, with a laudable desire to assign to the disease a
foreign origin, term it, deserve to be quoted: ‘Le temps est venu, je
pense, de prononcer le <i>De profundis</i> et les dernières prières
sur le soi-disant <i>modern style</i>, être abortif et adultérin,
qui porte un nom Anglais, mail est né vraiment en Allemagne, qui
n’est pas <i>moderne</i> puisqu’il paraît déjà suranné et court la
province—qui de plus n’est pas un <i>style</i>, comme it serait aisée
de le démontrer.’ <i>Un Manuscrit de Philippe le Bon.</i> (<i>Second
Article.</i>) <i>By M. S. Reinach.</i>—The author continues his
description of these remarkable miniatures and gives still further
proof, drawn from the types and gestures of the horses, for supposing
that its author is none other than Simon Marmion, of whose picture at
Wied he gives three illustrations. It is certain that the likenesses
to the early Dutch school, particularly to Dirk Bouts, are common both
to Simon Marmion and the miniaturist. While he is discussing Simon
Marmion, we hope M. Reinach will take account of the picture of St.
Michael attributed to the Flemish school at Hertford House (No. 528),
which bears, we think, the impress of his style. The idea had already
occurred independently to Mr. Claude Phillips. We hope that M. Reinach
will be able to secure rather better reproductions of the succeeding
miniatures in his forthcoming article. <i>Le Salon de 1761.</i>
(<i>Second article.</i>) <i>By M. Casimir Stryienski.</i>—By the aid
of the minute and brilliant sketches with which Gabriel de Saint-Aubin
annotated his catalogues, the author continues to trace the history
of the pictures which figured in this salon. The most interesting of
those here discussed is Chardin’s <i>Benedicite</i>, a second replica
of one of those in the Louvre. In this version the artist extended
his canvas laterally to take in another figure which he succeeded
in relating admirably with the original group. The purpose of this
change was to make his picture a companion piece to a Teniers. The
central composition was frequently repeated by contemporary copyists
and imitators. <i>Tradition française et musées d’art antique. By M.
Georges Toudouze.</i> —An eloquent appeal for the vulgarization of
art, in the proper sense of the word, by making the arrangement of
specimens more intelligible and interesting to the unlearned and by
adding to fragmentary figures explanatory models of the whole figure or
composition.</p>

both in the castle and the Brera, may well make us envy the energy
of the decadent Latin races. To take the Brera: in the last four
years, under the able direction of Signor Ricci, the Brera has been
entirely remodelled; the sixteen galleries have been increased to
thirty-five, in which the pictures are displayed according to their
affinities of time and place; the frescoes by Luini from the chapel of
S. Giuseppe in the della Pace have been placed on a vault expressly
adapted to them; while among the new acquisitions, mentioning only the
more important ones, we find eight frescoes by Bramante, four panels
by Gentile du Fabriano, one by Benozzo Gozzoli, several pieces by
Lazzaro Bastiani, Butinone, Beltraffio, Solario, Cosimo Tura, and a
magnificent Cima. In addition to this, that most desirable adjunct to
all places intended for the study of art, a large and representative
collection of photographs, has been installed. We fear that in spite of
our greater wealth the last four years’ acquisitions by the National
gallery would show poorly compared with the work accomplished in
this provincial town in Italy. <i>Butinone and Zenale</i>: a reply
by Malaguzzi Valeri to the criticisms of Herr Seidlitz, of which we
gave an abstract last month. In this he maintains the validity of the
date 145— for the altarpiece in the Brera, and brings in as evidence
for its possibility Foppa’s Crucifixion at Bergamo of 1456, which he
describes as showing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span> similar squarcionesque influence. We should
have said that the influence was rather that of Jacopo Bellini, and
that the squarcionesque element found its way later into Lombard art
and lingered on even when Leonardo was in the city. <i>Della Robbia at
Marseilles</i>: two school pieces, one of which is catalogued by Miss
Cruttwell, are figured and described by Signor Rossi. <i>La Rocella di
Squillace</i>: Dr. Groeschel replies to the article by Signor Caviglia
in the April number, in which this was referred to the sixth century.
The author says that the naves were covered with ogival vaults, and
that the church cannot antedate the end of the eleventh century.
<i>Miscellaneous Articles</i>: Don Guido Cagnola, who is well known
for his efforts in the preservation of works of art, writes to protest
against the disfigurement and obliteration of pictures and frescoes
by ecclesiastical authorities. An article signed Piceller describes
vividly the battle of San Egidio and the capture of Malatesta; the
description is fitted to the picture by Ucello in the National gallery.
This is evidence of how little attention is paid abroad to the work of
English historians of art, for Mr. Horne, in the <i>Monthly Review</i>
for October 1901, once and for all disposed of the theory that Ucello’s
picture represents this battle. With admirable patience and minute
research, he proved point by point that it represents the rout of
San Romano in which Niccolo da Tolentino defeated the Sienese under
Bernardino della Carda in 1432. His article leaves the matter no longer
open to such vague guesses. Among various items of news we learn that
a school piece of the Della Robbia which stood in the oratory of the
Annunziata at Legri has been stolen, or rather broken to pieces and the
greater part taken away.</p>

<p>The splendid exhibition at Bruges, of which Mr. W. H. James Weale
is writing for the readers of T<span class="smaller">HE</span>
B<span class="smaller">URLINGTON</span> M<span class="smaller">AGAZINE</span>
with that eminent proficiency for which he is so widely known, has
had an unexpected effect and has become the decisive cause of the
realization of a plan dear to numbers of French art-lovers. I refer
to an exhibition of French primitives. ¶ The origin of the talent of
the van Eycks has long preoccupied the minds of art-historians. M.
P. Durrieu said lately, in the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i>: ‘The
prodigious talent of the van Eycks seems to be revealed suddenly, like
a sort of brilliant meteor, which bursts forth and dazzles men’s eyes.
It presents a peculiarly attractive problem.’ ¶ The Bruges exhibition
has given a fresh impulse to the study of the question. On the other
hand, it has brought home to us the injustice of the profound neglect
into which we had allowed our old French masters to fall, while the
renown of the primitives of Flanders and Italy was increasing year
by year. Lastly, certain works attributed to the Flemish artists,
some of which even figured in this way in the Bruges exhibition, had
called for a more careful examination, which led eventually to French
attributions. The question was really pertinent. ¶ I have spoken
of ‘profound neglect.’ The expression is not strictly accurate. M.
Paul Vitry, of the Louvre, published lately a remarkable pamphlet
in which he resuscitated a whole collection of French works on our
old fifteenth-century painters. He quoted the studies of Vallet de
Viriville, of the Marquis de Laborde, of Messrs. de Grandmaison,
Bouchot, Leprieur, Durrieu, Salmon, Benoît, Salomon Reinach, etc. It
is nevertheless true that an undeserved ostracism and an unjustifiable
ignorance still weigh down upon the French primitives. ¶ Every
art-lover will applaud the happy initiative of M. Henri Bouchot,
the distinguished keeper of prints at the national library, who has
undertaken to restore to our painters of the middle ages and the
Renaissance the glorious place which they have the right to occupy in
the history of art. Without seeking in the least to detract from the
value of the Flemish primitives, it is nevertheless well to recall the
close connexion that exists between their work and that of our limners
of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, whose reputation at that
time was worldwide. Is it not likely that the latter were the masters
and leaders of the former? The artistic centre of the world in the
fourteenth century was the court of the Valois. We owe the prodigious
output of works of art that forms the pride of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries to those Maecenases who are known as Philip VI,
John II, Charles V, to the dukes of Berry, Anjou and Burgundy. ¶ M.
Bouchot has thought that it would be interesting to show <i>de visu</i>
how great was the influence upon the destinies of art of all those
master-pieces conceived and executed for princes so French in their
taste and language. Would it not be interesting to prove that the van
Eycks were the heirs of the Limbourg-Malouels, who worked in France for
the duke of Berry, and that such Flemings as Broderlam were inspired
by Jacquemart de Hesdin and André Beauneveu, themselves the successors
of our old Parisian miniature painter, Pucelle? ¶ Thanks to M. Henri
Bouchot, who knows this period of our national art better than any of
his contemporaries, the exhibition of French primitives has issued
from the conception stage and entered into the domain of active life.
It will be held in 1904. The French government has given its best
support. The exhibition is organized under the honorary presidency of
the minister of public instruction and the honorary vice-presidency of
the director of fine arts and the director of higher education, and it
will have for its acting president M. Aynard, member of the Institute,
and for its vice-presidents M. Georges Berger, president of the Union
centrale des Arts décoratifs, and M. Robert de Lasteyrie, member
of the Institute, professor at the École des Chartes. The members
of the managing committee are M. Léopold Delisle of the Institute,
administrator of the national library; M. Kaempfen, director of the
national museums; M. Pascal, of the Institute, in- spector-general of
civil buildings. The members of the council of organization are, for
painting, M. Georges Lafenestre, of the Institute; for miniatures, M.
Henri Omont, of the Institute; for tapestries, M. Maurice Fenaille;
for enamels, M. E. Saglio, of the Institute. The general secretary
is M. Henri Bouchot, keeper of the print-room and a member of the
consultative committee of T<span class="smaller">HE</span>
B<span class="smaller">URLINGTON</span> M<span class="smaller">AGAZINE</span>, assisted by
M. P. A. Lemoisne. The treasurer is M. T. Mortreuil, treasurer-general
of the national library, assisted by M. P. Lacombe. ¶ There will
doubtless be three exhibitions: one at the Louvre, which will include
the primitives of that museum and those of Cluny; the second at the
national library, consisting of the rich collection of miniatures
in the print-room. The third exhibition, the place of which is not
yet definitely fixed, will comprise the works lent by the provincial
museums and by private collectors. These will be very numerous and
very fine, to judge by the many kind offers which M. Henri Bouchot has
already received. I can only repeat the words of M. Paul Vitry and hope
with him that all those who set store by the glory of French art and of
art pure and simple will make a point of supporting ‘the Bouchot plan’
and giving it, at the exhibition of French primitives, ‘the benefit of
their knowledge and of their good will.’</p>

<h4>R<span class="smaller">OUEN</span>.</h4>

<p>To those who know the grand portal of the cathedral of Rouen,
resplendent with sculptural wealth, a master-piece of the sixteenth
century in all its magnificence, the work of its complete restoration,
which is now being pursued, will appear enormous. Thanks to the support
of the state, of the city of Rouen and of the diocesan administration,
this work will be entirely finished within a few years. ¶ It is
already, in fact, well forward. During the last three well-filled
years, they have restored, on either side of the central portion, a
whole row of little gables and fourteenth-century niches, in which
old statues, kept in reserve in the Tour de Beurre and the Cour
d’Albane, have been replaced. They have also completely reconstructed
and re-erected two large stone pyramids, 16 m. in height, which had
not been rebuilt since the terrible hurricane which in 1632, in a few
hours, overthrew most of the steeples and spires of the Rouen churches.
¶ These works were followed by the complete restoration of the large
central gable, against which the extremity of the roofing of the nave
rests, and by the entire repair of the great open gallery, dating to
the end of the fifteenth century. At the same time one of the great
buttresses flanking the main front was removed. They were erected in
our own time, when, after the fire of 1822, the new metal spire was
constructed by the architect Alavoine. This buttress, the carving of
which had never been executed, and which had remained corroded, has
been replaced by a large fourteenth-century buttress. There remains
another, which will also be entirely replaced. ¶ These different works
completing the restoration of the upper portions of the portal have
allowed an important part of the tall scaffolding that concealed it to
be removed. There still remains to be restored the whole of the lower
portion of the portal, notably the great gable, very much fretted
and sunk, which at present supports the clock; the great arch of the
rose-window and the rose itself; and, lastly, the covings, embellished
with innumerable small statues, sheltered under canopies, that form the
chief portal itself. It is to be hoped that they will be able to put
back all those delicious little figures of which a large number were
broken down by the Protestants: they will probably succeed in doing so,
for the credit placed at the disposal of the restoring architect, M.
Sauvageot, is about to be increased by a sum of 600,000 fr., bequeathed
to the archbishop for the express object of being employed exclusively
on this work of restitution in the cathedral, by M. Gosselin, an
architect who had long collaborated in the work of the cathedral
church. ¶ Several works have been carried out in the archbishop’s
palace itself. For instance, they have been engaged on the restoration
of a gallery, on the east side overlooking the garden, which was
built during the Renaissance by one of the Cardinals d’Amboise, at
the same time as a pretty fountain in marble, the memory of which
has been preserved by Jacques Le Lieur, who drew it for his ‘Livre
des fontaines.’ This gallery, supported by columns, is to be restored
to its original form. ¶ During the excavations necessitated by the
construction of an important building in the rue Grand Pont the eminent
archaeologist M. Léon de Vesly, corresponding member of the ministry
of public instruction, brought to light, at a depth of 5 m., numerous
fragments of red earthen Samos bowls, handsomely decorated. ¶ I will
mention the following among the objects discovered: the bottom of a
basin, in red earth, ·120 m. in diameter, with the inscription, SCOTNS:
<i>Scotnus</i> (See ‘Corpus inscriptionum latinarum,’ Vol. XII, p. 758.
<i>Scotnus</i>, Vase found at Nîmes and in the Saint-Germain museum). ¶
Another bottom of a dish, ·151 m., with the inscription
<span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">ONESM</span><span
class="denominator">CANNI</span></span>&#160;: <i>Onesimus Caï Annus</i>.
This is a mark of Arezzo read by M. Seymour de Ricci (See the
‘Corpus inscript.,’ Vol. XIII, part 3, p. 95). ¶ The bottom of a
<i>lecythus</i>, ·40 m., with, on a rectangular seal, the mark CACASIM.
¶ Fragments of a large amphora. On the rim, near the <i>sinus</i>,
from right to left, SEX VALECT: <i>Sextus Valenus fecit</i>, with a
cartouche with a rectangular border and circles.¶ Other discoveries
included an antefix of a somewhat rare character, seeing that the
Saint-Germain museum does not contain a similar one. It is decorated
with the figure of a child, full-face, with puffed cheeks, and forms
the stem of a palm-leaf. This is evidently the copy of a type of
antefix that came from Italy or Greece. Among the remains found in
the excavation were also found many bones of cattle, of the <i>Sus
scrofa</i>, or wild-sow, and vestiges of stakes, of which an array
had already been discovered previously, which might suggest the
existence of a lacustrine settlement in the neighbourhood of the
Seine. ¶ In the course of the excavations executed on the site of
the Haute Vieille Tour, where stood the original palace of the dukes
of Normandy, there were found, beside important vestiges of military
fortifications, a little bottle, in black earth, of Roman origin;
various bones, including numerous horns of the <i>cervus elephas</i>;
and two fifteenth-century tokens. One of these is ·026 m. in diameter,
and bears on the obverse a caravel, on the reverse a lozenged shield
charged with four fleurs-de-lys. It is said to resemble the English
noble. The other measures ·032 m. This is a French token, imitated
from the coinage of Dauphiné, a dolphin quartered with fleurs-de-lys.
A silver half-crown of Louis XV, dated 1741, was also found, as was a
token of German make of the eighteenth century, bearing on the obverse
a quartered shield and on the reverse the legend CVIQUE SVVM, and the
date 1701.</p>

<p>The staircase which at present gives access to the crypt in the
cathedral of St. Bavo at Ghent is to disappear in consequence of the
installation of the <i>Heilig Graf</i> in the place at which it starts.
In view of the artistic and archaeological importance of this vast
crypt, it will now be approached, as, for that matter, the greater
number of crypts were approached, by two staircases. With this object,
the two primitive staircases will simply be reinstated in their
original positions. The restoration of these primitive entrances is
desirable from another point of view: it will allow of the immediate
rebuilding of the lower portions of the columns, which were rashly cut
away, in the eighteenth century, for the installation of large marble
slabs. All the columns in the choir have undergone the same dangerous
mutilation; their bases have been slashed into, to a great depth,
right and left. So long ago as 1900, the royal commission on monuments
declared that it was necessary to take thought of this position of
affairs, which was capable, at a given moment, of compromising the very
existence of the building. ¶ In the crypt, two large funeral monuments
have been discovered. They are in marble, and belong to the Renaissance
period; they were originally in one of the chapels in the circumference
of the choir, whence they were removed to make room for some works of
restoration. These funeral monuments will be placed against the walls
of the south-east entrance of the church. ¶ Lastly, the commission has
requested the governor of the province to instruct the committee of
correspondents to draw up an inventory of the objects of art housed
in the cathedral crypt and to state, as far as possible, the origin
of these works, several of which appear to present a real artistic
importance.</p>

<h4>N<span class="smaller">IEUPORT</span></h4>

<p>The work of restoration of the fine church of Nieuport is being
actively carried out. In consequence of certain demolitions effected
since an earlier inspection, it has been ascertained that the
cross-vaulting of the transept was originally in wood, as were all the
other vaults of the building. A portion of the wooden ribs is still in
position, as is also the case with the remains of the shingle roofing.
All doubt being now resolved, this vault will be reinstated in wood. In
the wall of the south transept, a primitive window has been laid bare.
It was built up at the time of a general alteration of the edifice and
replaced by a larger bay. The window will be restored to its first
state. The removal of the covering of the south transept has shown that
the ridge of that portion of the monument is higher by about 50 cm.
than that of the adjacent roofings. As no alteration has taken place
in this part, the actual height of the roofing and of the south gable
will be maintained. Pains have been taken to restore the primitive
buttresses of the south nave, beside the choir, of which the old sites
have been found.</p>

<p>Within the last few months the picture gallery of Berlin has had the
opportunity of making some very fortunate purchases which supplement
the collection of pictures of the northern schools in a way that
is particularly desirable. The acquisition of the large picture by
Hugo van der Goes was an event for the Berlin gallery, one of those
purchases which may suffice to reconcile an acquisitive curator with
the chances of a restless profession for another year or two. ¶ Of the
pictures of older German masters the gallery had the opportunity of
buying two striking works. The Rest on the Flight of the year 1504,
always acknowledged as Lucas Cranach’s best picture, passed from the
hands of Frau Fiedler of Munich, the widow of its last owner, into the
possession of the Berlin gallery. The picture, enamel-like in painting
and in excellent preservation, was formerly in the Schiarra gallery in
Rome. Further, they succeeded in acquiring one of the few authentic
panels of Martin Schongauer, a painting of moderate dimensions, very
near akin to the Münich, and still more to the Vienna Madonna pictures.
Of particular charm is the sunny bright landscape in the background.
¶ The gallery hitherto lacked a great religious painting by Rubens;
this default is now very happily atoned by the acquisition of the
Conversion of Paul. The picture, that dates from about the time of the
great religious pictures of Antwerp, reveals stress of emotion and
very penetrating harsh illumination. Of the recently acquired Italian
pictures only one deserves comment here; but this is a master work—the
Resurrection of Christ, by Giovanni Bellini, of the earlier period of
the master.</p>

<p>To-day Vienna has its modern gallery. The old
possessions of the municipal art gallery and of the academy of the
graphic arts furnished the foundations for this new institution, and
the works acquired of late years in behalf of the state and of the
province of Lower Austria supplement this nucleus in such a way as
to give us to-day a fairly comprehensive review of the evolution of
art in Austria since the year 1848. Some 200 well-chosen paintings
adorn the old and venerable apartments of the Lower Belvedere—in the
palace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span> that is to say, which Prince Eugene of Savoy commissioned
Lucas von Hildebrand (1668–1745) to build for him. ¶ Some few masters,
such as Rudolf von Alt, Hans Makart, Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller, who
have carried their names and the fame of their art far beyond the
boundaries of their native land, are represented by a considerable
number of their works. Other ornaments of the Vienna school, such as
Moriz Schwind, Joseph Danhauser, Joseph Führich, E. Jacob Schindler,
are unfortunately by no means represented in proportion to the claims
of their art or fame. Whether in these cases mistakes in selection—for
the storehouse still contains great treasures—or actual dearth of the
works of the one or the other was the cause we are not in a position
to decide. In any case the authorities of the new museum of the town
of Vienna, whither on its completion the modern gallery is to migrate,
have their work cut out here to make good all the mistakes that have
been committed in their time, and to restore the monuments of eminent
men which have slipped somewhat into the background of the temple of
fame to their proper places. The right wing of the palace is devoted
to foreign artists. Germany is represented by Klinger, Böcklin,
Stuck, Uhde, Achenbach; Italy by Segantini; France by Monet, Rolt and
Dagnan-Bouveret; England and the Netherlands by Alma Tadema; and Spain
by Zuloaga.</p>

<p>In your July number, Mr. Cecil Smith states that the head of a girl,
from Chios, recently exhibited in the Burlington Fine Arts club,
is rubbed down ruinously over the entire surface. A microscopic
examination of the piece in various lights will convince him, or anyone
open to conviction, that his statement is plainly contrary to fact.
Seldom is seen a marble with greater freshness of surface. ¶ That
the original modelling is evanescent—or, as he may care to call it,
‘rubbed down’—is obvious, even to me; but the whole effect, good or
bad, depends on that evanescence, which is found repeatedly in works
which aim at Praxitelean effects. ¶ Mr. Smith having given you his
estimate of the head as a work of art, allow me to quote the judgement
of another man, Auguste Rodin, almost equally eminent. When questioned
by an interviewer concerning his impressions of London during his
recent visit, he is reported to have answered: ‘This time I have been
most fortunate, for I have seen at the Burlington Fine Arts club
an antique head of great beauty. It is life itself. It embodies all
that is beautiful, life itself, beauty itself. It is admirable! Those
parted lips! I am not a man of letters, hence I am unable to describe
this truly great work of art. I feel, but I cannot find the words to
express what I feel. It is a Venus. I cannot tell you how interesting
that Venus is to me. It is a flower, a perfect gem. Perfect to such
a degree that it is “aussi déroutante que la nature elle-même!” It
defies description.’ ¶ The interviewer thought M. Rodin was speaking of
the Petworth Aphrodite, but a few inquiries will enable Mr. Smith to
find out the truth of the matter, if it is worth his while. ¶ Thus it
appears that about a model in partly-melted loaf-sugar there may be as
diverse opinions as concerning the tone of a cracked bell.</p>

<p>[Another copy of this Denunzia, written in the same hand, occurs in the
Campione del Monte; Quartiere, Santa Maria Novella; Gonfalone, Vipera;
1480; No. 54, fol. 59.</p>

<p>A portion of this second copy is facsimiled in G. Milanesi’s ‘Scrittura
di Artisti Italiani’ (Sec. XIV-XVII), Florence, 1876, Vol. I, No. 74.
In the text which accompanies this plate, it is erroneously stated that
the facsimile was taken from the foregoing copy.</p>

<p>In the copy printed above, the official marginalia on the left margin
of the document are no longer legible. In the second copy, in the
Campione del Monte, they run thus. Against the first parcel of land,
under the heading ‘Sustantia’:—‘Dal 69 nichio c. 668 dachont<sup>o</sup> dj Rede
di charlo Ridolfi per R<i>endit</i><sup>a</sup> dj f<i>iorinj</i> 2.16.6 dasoma
dj f<i>iorinj</i> 44 <i>soldj</i> 5 diR<i>endit</i><sup>a</sup> [sic].’ Against
the second parcel of land, under the same heading:—‘Dal 69 G<sup>o</sup> L<sup>o</sup> c<sup>o</sup>
c. 930 da chont<sup>o</sup> d<i>i</i>santj d<i>i</i>simone anbruogj p<i>er</i>

second copy, on fol. 72 tergo, ‘R<i>ech</i><sup>o</sup> alesso al 28 diG<sup>o</sup>,’ that
the return in question was lodged with the officials by Alesso himself
on June 28, 1480.</p>

<p>J. Gaye, in his ‘Carteggio d’Artisti,’ Firenze, 1839, Vol. I, p. 224,
cites this ‘Denunzia’; and erroneously alludes to Mea, as the daughter
of Alesso.]</p>

of his family, Francesco Baldovinetti, though cited by Domenico Maria
Manni, in the footnotes to his edition of Baldinucci,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and more
recently, by the various commentators of Vasari, have never been
printed at length. I cannot more fitly bring these notices of Alesso to
a conclusion than by giving them textually for the first time from the
original manuscript.</p>

      my friend Dr. A. Warburg, whose name is known to all students of
      Florentine art, has kindly communicated to me a copy of a series of
      additional notices to, and annotations upon, the foregoing passages
      from the ‘Memoriale’ of Francesco Baldovinetti. The copy in question
      is in a modern Italian hand, written apparently some thirty years ago;
      and it is bound up with a copy of Dr. Pierrotti’s ‘Ricordi di Alesso
      Baldovinetti,’ which came from the library of the late Eugene Müntz.
      There is no indication in this copy of the source whence these
      additional notices were derived, but it is clear from internal
      evidence that they were collected by a member of the Baldovinetti
      family, c. 1750; and I suspect that they were copied from the
      voluminous genealogical collections of Giovanni Baldovinetti, which,
      with other manuscripts once belonging to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
      that family, are now preserved in the national library at Florence.
      After citing, with some omissions, the foregoing passages from the
      ‘Memoriale’ of Francesco Baldovinetti, the writer of these additional

<p class="mtop1">¶ [It is significant that two of the three errors which we are now
able to detect in the foregoing passages from the ‘Memoriale’ of
Francesco Baldovinetti, should consist in the attribution to Alesso
of the paintings by Domenico Veneziano, once in the tabernacle at the
Canto de’ Carnesecchi, and the fresco of ‘Christ at the Column’ by
Andrea da Castagno,” formerly in the cloister of S. Croce: for Alesso
was undoubtedly the pupil of Domenico, as his early works prove; and
the assistant of Andrea, as he himself states in his ‘Ricordi.’ Of the
paintings which Alesso is here stated to have executed in the cloister
of the monastery of S. Benedetto al Mugnone, beyond the Porta a Pinti,
near to where is now the Barriera della Querce, at Florence, no other
notices have come down to us. Here, again, it is significant that
Vasari records that at S. Benedetto were works by the hand of Andrea
da Castagno, both ‘in a cloister, and in the church’<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>; but it
must be remembered that the monastery had long been destroyed at the
time Vasari wrote; and that he himself had never seen the cloister in
question.]</p>

<p>¶ [The patronage of the church of S. Piero in Calicarza was already,
at the beginning of the fourteenth century, in the possession of the
Baldovinetti, who also owned the ‘torre,’ or fortified villa, called
La Rocca Perduta, which stood near the church. It is probable that the
Baldovinetti had possessed this property from very early times. It
lies but a few miles from Fiesole, on the hills above the further side
of the valley of the Mugnone, beyond the Medicean villa of Pratolino.
According to Ugolino Verino’s Latin poem, ‘De Illustratione Urbis
Florentiae,’<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> the Baldovinetti had their origin in Fiesole, during
Roman times:</p>

<p>¶ [One passage in the ‘Memoriale’ of Francesco Baldovinetti has been
passed over in silence by all the writers who have cited that document,
from Domenico Maria Manni onwards. It is that in which it is stated
that Alesso made the tomb for himself at S. Lorenzo, in which he was
buried, ‘because those of his own house held him to be a bastard.’
This would explain why Alesso, as the writer of the additional notices
records, renounced on December 15, 1465, his right of inheritance to
the estate of his father who had died intestate, and why he afterwards
disinherited his family, and left his property to the hospital of S.
Paolo. The ‘rogiti’ for the year 1465, of the notary, Ser Bartolommeo
di Ser Guido Guidi, who engrossed the instrument by which Alesso
renounced his right of inheritance in that year, have not been
preserved among the notarial archives, in the Archivio di Stato, of
Florence.]</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> ‘Labarum’ was the name given before the time of
Constantine, and apparently as far back as that of Hadrian, in the
Roman army to the standard of the cavalry. Gradually this became the
standard of the whole army, and in its later developments the banner
became surmounted by the Eagle of Victory, but always with the cross
beneath. Constantine replaced the eagle by the sacred monogram (the
Greek letter P traversed by X); he further embroidered the Christian
emblems on the purple of the banner in gold and jewels, and beneath
these he placed medallions representing in portraiture himself and his
children.</p>

a narrow interval or springs directly from it. Compare the examples
of the eighth to twelfth century figured in Otte’s Handbuch, and
the French examples of the Church of St. Gauzelin and of St. Rémy.
(Exposition rétrospective, Paris, 1900. Catalogue illustré, pp. 65,

slightly turned-out lip which characterizes English chalices of early

‘Portata della Decima,’ in Gonfalone Drago, Quartiere di Santo Spirito.

with the exception of the bidding by South Kensington and myself, there
was no competition for the drawings, though every dealer in London was
struggling at the sale—the Gambart—for cheap and rubbishy, though
popular, French and Spanish water-colours that brought far higher
prices owing to some fad of the moment.</p>

owe much for having first called my attention, some years ago, to the
possibilities of Andrea as an artist. The first of these is the sacred
picture of the Madonna in the great pilgrimage church on Monte Nero,
near Leghorn. The second, a damaged, almost ruined fresco in the church

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
